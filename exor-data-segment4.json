Definitions. For the purposes of this order:\n\n                    (a) ``Agency'' means an executive agency as defined \n                in section 105 of title 5, United States Code, but does \n                not include the Government Accountability Office.\n                    (b) ``Contractor employee'' means an individual who \n                performs work for or on behalf of any agency under a \n                contract and who, in order to perform the work \n                specified under the contract, will require access to \n                space, information, information technology systems, \n                staff, or other assets of the Federal Government. Such \n                contracts, include, but are not limited to:\n\n  (i) personal services contracts;\n\n  (ii) contracts between any non-Federal entity and any agency; and\n\n  (iii) sub-contracts between any non-Federal entity and another non-\nFederal entity to perform work related to the primary contract with the \nagency.\n\n                    (c) ``Excepted service'' has the meaning provided \n                in section 2103 of title 5, United States Code, but \n                does not include those positions in any element of the \n                intelligence community as defined in the National \n                Security Act of 1947, as amended, to the extent they \n                are not otherwise subject to Office of Personnel \n                Management appointing authorities.\n                    (d) ``Fitness'' is the level of character and \n                conduct determined necessary for an individual to \n                perform work for or on behalf of a Federal agency as an \n                employee in the excepted service (other than a position \n                subject to suitability) or as a contractor employee.\n                    (e) ``Fitness determination'' means a decision by \n                an agency that an individual has or does not have the \n                required level of character and conduct necessary to \n                perform work for or on behalf of a Federal agency as an \n                employee in the excepted service (other than a position \n                subject to suitability) or as a contractor employee. A \n                favorable fitness determination is not a decision to \n                appoint or contract with an individual.\n                    (f) ``Position of Public Trust'' has the meaning \n                provided in 5 CFR Part 731.\n                    (g) ``Suitability'' has the meaning and coverage \n                provided in CFR Part 731.\n\n[[Page 4112]]\n\n                 Sec. 3.  Agency Authority to Set Fitness Criteria and \n                Determine Equivalency. The authority to establish \n                criteria for making fitness determinations remains \n                within the discretion of the agency head. Agency heads \n                also have the discretion to determine whether their \n                criteria are equivalent to suitability standards \n                established by the Office of Personnel Management. \n                Agency heads shall take into account Office of \n                Personnel Management guidance when exercising this \n                discretion.\n\n                 Sec. 4.  Reciprocal Recognition of Fitness and \n                Suitability Determinations. (a) Except as provided by \n                subsection (b) of this section, agencies making fitness \n                determinations shall grant reciprocal recognition to a \n                prior favorable fitness or suitability determination \n                when:\n\n  (i) the gaining agency uses criteria for making fitness determinations \nequivalent to suitability standards established by the Office of Personnel \nManagement;\n\n  (ii) the prior favorable fitness or suitability determination was based \non criteria equivalent to suitability standards established by the Office \nof Personnel Management; and\n\n  (iii) the individual has had no break in employment since the favorable \ndetermination was made.\n\n                    (b) Exceptions to Reciprocal Recognition. A gaining \n                agency is not required to grant reciprocal recognition \n                to a prior favorable fitness or suitability \n                determination when:\n\n  (i) the new position requires a higher level of investigation than \npreviously conducted for that individual;\n\n  (ii) an agency obtains new information that calls into question the \nindividual's fitness based on character or conduct; or\n\n  (iii) the individual's investigative record shows conduct that is \nincompatible with the core duties of the new position.\n\n                 Sec. 5.  Reinvestigation of Individuals in Positions \n                of Public Trust. Individuals in positions of public \n                trust shall be subject to reinvestigation under \n                standards (including but not limited to the frequency \n                of such reinvestigation) as determined by the Director \n                of the Office of Personnel Management, to ensure their \n                suitability for continued employment.\n\n                 Sec. 6.  Responsibilities. (a) An agency shall report \n                to the Office of Personnel Management the nature and \n                results of the background investigation and fitness \n                determination (or later changes to that determination) \n                made on an individual, to the extent consistent with \n                law.\n\n                    (b) The Director of the Office of Personnel \n                Management is delegated authority to implement this \n                order, including the authority to issue regulations and \n                guidance governing suitability, or guidance related to \n                fitness, as the Director determines appropriate.\n\n                 Sec. 7. General Provisions.  (a) Nothing in this order \n                shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n  (i) authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the head \nthereof; or\n\n  (ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget \nrelating to budget, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n                    (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with \n                applicable law and subject to the availability of \n                appropriations.\n                    (c) This order shall not suspend, impede, or \n                otherwise affect Executive Order 10450 of April 27, \n                1953, as amended, or Executive Order 13467 of June 30, \n                2008;\n                    (d) This order is intended only to improve the \n                internal management of the executive branch and is not \n                intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, \n                substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in \n                equity by any party against the United States, its \n                agencies, instrumentalities, or entities, its officers, \n                employees or agents, or any other person.\n\n[[Page 4113]]\n\n                 Sec. 8.

Policy. (a) Wise regulatory decisions depend \n                on public participation and on careful analysis of the \n                likely consequences of regulation. Such decisions are \n                informed and improved by allowing interested members of \n                the public to have a meaningful opportunity to \n                participate in rulemaking. To the extent permitted by \n                law, such decisions should be made only after \n                consideration of their costs and benefits (both \n                quantitative and qualitative).\n\n                    (b) Executive Order 13563 of January 18, 2011, \n                ``Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review,'' \n                directed to executive agencies, was meant to produce a \n                regulatory system that protects ``public health, \n                welfare, safety, and our environment while promoting \n                economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job \n                creation.'' Independent regulatory agencies, no less \n                than executive agencies, should promote that goal.\n                    (c) Executive Order 13563 set out general \n                requirements directed to executive agencies concerning \n                public participation, integration and innovation, \n                flexible approaches, and science. To the extent \n                permitted by law, independent regulatory agencies \n                should comply with these provisions as well.\n\n                Sec. 2. Retrospective Analyses of Existing Rules. (a) \n                To facilitate the periodic review of existing \n                significant regulations, independent regulatory \n                agencies should consider how best to promote \n                retrospective analysis of rules that may be outmoded, \n                ineffective, insufficient, or excessively burdensome, \n                and to modify, streamline, expand, or repeal them in \n                accordance with what has been learned. Such \n                retrospective analyses, including supporting data and \n                evaluations, should be released online whenever \n                possible.\n\n                    (b) Within 120 days of the date of this order, each \n                independent regulatory agency should develop and \n                release to the public a plan, consistent with law and \n                reflecting its resources and regulatory priorities and \n                processes, under which the agency will periodically \n                review its existing significant regulations to \n                determine whether any such regulations should be \n                modified, streamlined, expanded, or repealed so as to \n                make the agency's regulatory program more effective or \n                less burdensome in achieving the regulatory objectives.\n\n                Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) For purposes of this \n                order, ``executive agency'' shall have the meaning set \n                forth for the term ``agency'' in section 3(b) of \n                Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993, and \n                ``independent regulatory agency'' shall have the \n                meaning set forth in 44 U.S.C. 3502(5).\n\n                    (b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to \n                impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i) authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the head \nthereof; or\n\n(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget \nrelating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n                    (c) This order shall be implemented consistent with \n                applicable law and subject to the availability of \n                appropriations.\n\n[[Page 41588]]\n\n                    (d) This order is not intended to, and does not, \n                create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, \n                enforceable at law or in equity by any party against \n                the United States, its departments, agencies, or \n                entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any \n                other person.\n                &lt;GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT&gt;\n                \n                    (Presidential Sig.)\n\n                THE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n                    July 11, 2011.\n\n[FR Doc. 2011-17953\nFiled 7-13-11; 11:15 am]\nBilling code 3195-W1-P\n\n\n</pre>]","url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2011/07/14/2011-17953/regulation-and-independent-regulatory-agencies","president":"obama","id":"13579"},"reftime":1418257677187}

Policy.  Our Nation derives strength from \n                the diversity of its population and from its commitment \n                to equal opportunity for all. We are at our best when \n                we draw on the talents of all parts of our society, and \n                our greatest accomplishments are achieved when diverse \n                perspectives are brought to bear to overcome our \n                greatest challenges.\n\n                A commitment to equal opportunity, diversity, and \n                inclusion is critical for the Federal Government as an \n                employer. By law, the Federal Government's recruitment \n                policies should ``endeavor to achieve a work force from \n                all segments of society.'' (5 U.S.C. 2301(b)(1)). As \n                the Nation's largest employer, the Federal Government \n                has a special obligation to lead by example. Attaining \n                a diverse, qualified workforce is one of the \n                cornerstones of the merit-based civil service.\n\n                Prior Executive Orders, including but not limited to \n                those listed below, have taken a number of steps to \n                address the leadership role and obligations of the \n                Federal Government as an employer. For example, \n                Executive Order 13171 of October 12, 2000 (Hispanic \n                Employment in the Federal Government), directed \n                executive departments and agencies to implement \n                programs for recruitment and career development of \n                Hispanic employees and established a mechanism for \n                identifying best practices in doing so. Executive Order \n                13518 of November 9, 2009 (Employment of Veterans in \n                the Federal Government), required the establishment of \n                a Veterans Employment Initiative. Executive Order 13548 \n                of July 26, 2010 (Increasing Federal Employment of \n                Individuals with Disabilities), and its related \n                predecessors, Executive Order 13163 of July 26, 2000 \n                (Increasing the Opportunity for Individuals With \n                Disabilities to be Employed in the Federal Government), \n                and Executive Order 13078 of March 13, 1998 (Increasing \n                Employment of Adults With Disabilities), sought to tap \n                the skills of the millions of Americans living with \n                disabilities.\n\n                To realize more fully the goal of using the talents of \n                all segments of society, the Federal Government must \n                continue to challenge itself to enhance its ability to \n                recruit, hire, promote, and retain a more diverse \n                workforce. Further, the Federal Government must create \n                a culture that encourages collaboration, flexibility, \n                and fairness to enable individuals to participate to \n                their full potential.\n\n                Wherever possible, the Federal Government must also \n                seek to consolidate compliance efforts established \n                through related or overlapping statutory mandates, \n                directions from Executive Orders, and regulatory \n                requirements. By this order, I am directing executive \n                departments and agencies (agencies) to develop and \n                implement a more comprehensive, integrated, and \n                strategic focus on diversity and inclusion as a key \n                component of their human resources strategies. This \n                approach should include a continuing effort to identify \n                and adopt best practices, implemented in an integrated \n                manner, to promote diversity and remove barriers to \n                equal employment opportunity, consistent with merit \n                system principles and applicable law.\n\n[[Page 52848]]\n\n                Sec. 2.

Definitions. As used in this order:\n\n                    (a) ``Common Article 3'' means Article 3 of each of \n                the Geneva Conventions.\n                    (b) ``Geneva Conventions'' means:\n\n  (i) the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded \nand Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3114);\n\n  (ii) the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, \nSick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, August 12, 1949 (6 UST \n3217);\n\n  (iii) the Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, \nAugust 12, 1949 (6 UST 3316); and\n\n  (iv) the Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in \nTime of War, August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3516).\n\n                    (c) ``Individuals currently detained at \n                Guant[aacute]namo'' and ``individuals covered by this \n                order'' mean individuals currently detained by the \n                Department of Defense in facilities at the \n                Guant[aacute]namo Bay Naval Base whom the Department of \n                Defense has ever determined to be, or treated as, enemy \n                combatants.\n\n                Sec. 2. Findings.\n\n                    (a) Over the past 7 years, approximately 800 \n                individuals whom the Department of Defense has ever \n                determined to be, or treated as, enemy combatants have \n                been detained at Guant[aacute]namo. The Federal \n                Government has moved more than 500 such detainees from \n                Guant[aacute]namo, either by returning them to their \n                home country or by releasing or transferring them to a \n                third country. The Department of Defense has determined \n                that a number of the individuals currently detained at \n                Guant[aacute]namo are eligible for such transfer or \n                release.\n                    (b) Some individuals currently detained at \n                Guant[aacute]namo have been there for more than 6 \n                years, and most have been detained for at least 4 \n                years. In view of the significant concerns raised by \n                these detentions, both within the United States and \n                internationally, prompt and appropriate disposition of \n                the individuals currently detained at Guant[aacute]namo \n                and closure of the facilities in which they are \n                detained would further the national security and \n                foreign policy interests of the United States and the \n                interests of justice. Merely closing the facilities \n                without promptly determining the appropriate \n                disposition of the individuals detained would not \n                adequately serve those interests. To the extent \n                practicable, the prompt and appropriate disposition of \n                the individuals detained at Guant[aacute]namo should \n                precede the closure of the detention facilities at \n                Guant[aacute]namo.\n                    (c) The individuals currently detained at \n                Guant[aacute]namo have the constitutional privilege of \n                the writ of habeas corpus. Most of those individuals\n\n[[Page 4898]]\n\n                have filed petitions for a writ of habeas corpus in \n                Federal court challenging the lawfulness of their \n                detention.\n                    (d) It is in the interests of the United States \n                that the executive branch undertake a prompt and \n                thorough review of the factual and legal bases for the \n                continued detention of all individuals currently held \n                at Guant[aacute]namo, and of whether their continued \n                detention is in the national security and foreign \n                policy interests of the United States and in the \n                interests of justice. The unusual circumstances \n                associated with detentions at Guant[aacute]namo require \n                a comprehensive interagency review.\n                    (e) New diplomatic efforts may result in an \n                appropriate disposition of a substantial number of \n                individuals currently detained at Guant[aacute]namo.\n                    (f) Some individuals currently detained at \n                Guant[aacute]namo may have committed offenses for which \n                they should be prosecuted. It is in the interests of \n                the United States to review whether and how any such \n                individuals can and should be prosecuted.\n                    (g) It is in the interests of the United States \n                that the executive branch conduct a prompt and thorough \n                review of the circumstances of the individuals \n                currently detained at Guant[aacute]namo who have been \n                charged with offenses before military commissions \n                pursuant to the Military Commissions Act of 2006, \n                Public Law 109-366, as well as of the military \n                commission process more generally.\n\n                Sec. 3. Closure of Detention Facilities at \n                Guant[aacute]namo. The detention facilities at \n                Guant[aacute]namo for individuals covered by this order \n                shall be closed as soon as practicable, and no later \n                than 1 year from the date of this order. If any \n                individuals covered by this order remain in detention \n                at Guant[aacute]namo at the time of closure of those \n                detention facilities, they shall be returned to their \n                home country, released, transferred to a third country, \n                or transferred to another United States detention \n                facility in a manner consistent with law and the \n                national security and foreign policy interests of the \n                United States.\n\n                Sec. 4. Immediate Review of All Guant[aacute]namo \n                Detentions.\n\n                    (a) Scope and Timing of Review. A review of the \n                status of each individual currently detained at \n                Guant[aacute]namo (Review) shall commence immediately.\n                    (b) Review Participants. The Review shall be \n                conducted with the full cooperation and participation \n                of the following officials:\n\n  (1) the Attorney General, who shall coordinate the Review;\n\n  (2) the Secretary of Defense;\n\n  (3) the Secretary of State;\n\n  (4) the Secretary of Homeland Security;\n\n  (5) the Director of National Intelligence;\n\n  (6) the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and\n\n  (7) other officers or full-time or permanent part-time employees of the \nUnited States, including employees with intelligence, counterterrorism, \nmilitary, and legal expertise, as determined by the Attorney General, with \nthe concurrence of the head of the department or agency concerned.\n\n                    (c) Operation of Review.

All executive branch departments and \nagencies shall promptly comply with any request of the Attorney General to \nprovide information in their possession or control pertaining to any such \nindividual.

The Review shall determine, on a rolling \nbasis and as promptly as possible with respect to the individuals currently \ndetained at Guant[aacute]namo, whether it is possible to transfer or \nrelease the individuals consistent with the national security and foreign \npolicy interests of the United States and, if so, whether and how the \nSecretary of Defense may effect their transfer or release. The Secretary of \nDefense, the Secretary of State, and, as appropriate, other Review \nparticipants shall work to effect promptly the release or transfer of all \nindividuals for whom release or transfer is possible.\n\n  (3) Determination of Prosecution. In accordance with United States law, \nthe cases of individuals detained at Guant[aacute]namo not approved for \nrelease or transfer shall be evaluated to determine whether the Federal \nGovernment should seek to prosecute the detained individuals for any \noffenses they may have committed, including whether it is feasible to \nprosecute such individuals before a court established pursuant to Article \nIII of the United States Constitution, and the Review participants shall in \nturn take the necessary and appropriate steps based on such determinations.\n\n  (4) Determination of Other Disposition. With respect to any individuals \ncurrently detained at Guant[aacute]namo whose disposition is not achieved \nunder paragraphs (2) or (3) of this subsection, the Review shall select \nlawful means, consistent with the national security and foreign policy \ninterests of the United States and the interests of justice, for the \ndisposition of such individuals.

On some occasions, however, a \n                successor contractor or its subcontractors hires a new \n                work force, thus displacing the predecessor's \n                employees.\n\n                The Federal Government's procurement interests in \n                economy and efficiency are served when the successor \n                contractor hires the predecessor's employees. A \n                carryover work force reduces disruption to the delivery \n                of services during the period of transition between \n                contractors and provides the Federal Government the \n                benefits of an experienced and trained work force that \n                is familiar with the Federal Government's personnel, \n                facilities, and requirements.\n\n                Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President \n                by the Constitution and the laws of the United States \n                of America, including the Federal Property and \n                Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 101 et seq., and \n                in order to promote economy and efficiency in Federal \n                Government procurement, it is hereby ordered as \n                follows:\n\n                Section 1. Policy. It is the policy of the Federal \n                Government that service contracts and solicitations for \n                such contracts shall include a clause that requires the \n                contractor, and its subcontractors, under a contract \n                that succeeds a contract for performance of the same or \n                similar services at the same location, to offer those \n                employees (other than managerial and supervisory \n                employees) employed under the predecessor contract \n                whose employment will be terminated as a result of the \n                award of the successor contract, a right of first \n                refusal of employment under the contract in positions \n                for which they are qualified. There shall be no \n                employment openings under the contract until such right \n                of first refusal has been provided.

Purpose. The United States has a unique \n                legal relationship with Indian tribes and a special \n                relationship with Alaska Native entities as provided in \n                the Constitution of the United States, treaties, and \n                Federal statutes.

With respect to the prohibitions contained in \n                section 2 of this order, consistent with subsection \n                5(b) of the SAA, I hereby determine that it is in the \n                national security interest of the United States to \n                waive, and hereby waive, application of subsection \n                5(a)(2)(D) of the SAA insofar as it pertains to: \n                aircraft of any air carrier owned or controlled by \n                Syria chartered by the Syrian government for the \n                transport of Syrian government officials to and from \n                the United States on official Syrian government \n                business, to the extent consistent with Department of \n                Transportation regulations; takeoffs or landings for \n                non-traffic stops of aircraft of any such air carrier \n                that is not engaged in scheduled international air \n                services; takeoffs and landings associated with an \n                emergency; and overflights of United States territory.\n\n                Sec. 9. I hereby direct the Secretary of State to take \n                such actions, including the promulgation of rules and \n                regulations, as may be necessary to carry out \n                subsection 1(a) of this order. I hereby direct the \n                Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the \n                Secretary of State, to take such actions, including the \n                promulgation of rules and regulations, as may be \n                necessary to carry out subsection 1(b) of this order. I \n                direct the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State, to take such actions, \n                including the promulgation of rules and regulations, as \n                may be necessary to carry out section 2 of this order. \n                The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the \n                Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such \n                actions, including the promulgation of rules and \n                regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the \n                President by the IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out \n                sections 3, 4, and 5 of this order. The Secretaries of \n                State, Commerce, Transportation, and the Treasury may \n                redelegate any of these functions to other officers and \n                agencies of the United States Government consistent \n                with applicable law. The Secretary of State, in \n                consultation with the Secretaries of Commerce, \n                Transportation, and the Treasury, as appropriate, is \n                authorized to exercise the functions and authorities \n                conferred upon the President in subsection 5(b) of the \n                SAA and to redelegate these functions and authorities \n                consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the \n                United States Government are hereby directed to take \n                all appropriate measures within their authority to \n                carry out the provisions of this order and, where \n                appropriate, to advise the Secretaries of State, \n                Commerce, Transportation, and the Treasury in a timely \n                manner of the measures taken.\n\n                Sec. 10. This order is not intended to create, and does \n                not create, any right or benefit, substantive or \n                procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any \n                party against the United States, its departments, \n                agencies, instrumentalities, or entities, its officers \n                or employees, or any other person.\n\n                Sec. 11. For those persons whose property or interests \n                in property are blocked pursuant to section 3 of this \n                order who might have a constitutional presence in the \n                United States, I find that because of the ability to \n                transfer funds or assets instantaneously, prior notice \n                to such persons of measures\n\n[[Page 26754]]\n\n                to be taken pursuant to this order would render these \n                measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for \n                these measures to be effective in addressing the \n                national emergency declared in this order, there need \n                be no prior notice of a listing or determination made \n                pursuant to this order.\n\n                Sec. 12.

Policy. The United States is the world's \n                largest economy and the largest trading Nation. Trade \n                is critical to the Nation's prosperity--fueling \n                economic growth, supporting good jobs at home, raising \n                living standards, and helping Americans provide for \n                their families with affordable goods and services. It \n                is the policy of the United States to promote commerce \n                through the effective implementation of an ambitious \n                21st century trade agenda and vigorous enforcement of \n                our Nation's laws relating to trade, security, public \n                health and safety, the environment, and natural \n                resources. In support of these goals, and to ensure \n                that our Nation is well-positioned to compete in an \n                open, fair, and growing world economy, the Federal \n                Government must increase efforts to improve the \n                technologies, policies, and other controls governing \n                the movement of goods across our national borders.\n\n                In particular, we must increase efforts to complete the \n                development of efficient and cost-effective trade \n                processing infrastructure, such as the International \n                Trade Data System (ITDS), to modernize and simplify the \n                way that executive departments and agencies (agencies) \n                interact with traders. We must also improve the broader \n                trade environment through the development of innovative \n                policies and operational processes that promote \n                effective application of regulatory controls, \n                collaborative arrangements with stakeholders, and a \n                reduction of unnecessary procedural requirements that \n                add costs to both agencies and industry and undermine \n                our Nation's economic competitiveness. By demonstrating \n                our commitment to utilizing technology, coordinating \n                government processes, fulfilling international \n                obligations, and embracing innovative approaches to \n                promote new opportunities for trade facilitation in the \n                21st century, we can lead by example and partner with \n                other countries willing to adopt similar programs. This \n                will encourage compliance with applicable laws and, \n                more broadly, result in a more prosperous, safe, \n                secure, and sustainable trading environment for all.\n\n                Sec. 2. Policy Coordination. Policy coordination, \n                guidance, dispute resolution, and periodic reviews for \n                the functions and programs set forth in this order \n                shall be provided through the interagency process \n                established in Presidential Policy Directive-1 of \n                February 13, 2009 (Organization of the National \n                Security Council System), or any successor.\n\n                Sec. 3. International Trade Data System. The ITDS, as \n                described in section 405 of the Security and \n                Accountability for Every Port Act of 2006 (the ``SAFE \n                Port Act'') (Public Law 109-347), is an electronic \n                information exchange capability, or ``single window,'' \n                through which businesses will transmit data required by \n                participating agencies for the importation or \n                exportation of cargo. To enhance Federal coordination \n                associated with the development of the ITDS and to \n                provide necessary transparency to businesses, agencies, \n                and other potential users:\n\n[[Page 10658]]\n\n                    (a) by December 31, 2016, participating agencies \n                shall have capabilities, agreements, and other \n                requirements in place to utilize the ITDS and \n                supporting systems, such as the Automated Commercial \n                Environment, as the primary means of receiving from \n                users the standard set of data and other relevant \n                documentation (exclusive of applications for permits, \n                licenses, or certifications) required for the release \n                of imported cargo and clearance of cargo for export;\n                    (b) by December 31, 2016, the Department of \n                Homeland Security shall confirm to the Secretary of the \n                Treasury and the ITDS Board of Directors (Board), which \n                serves as the Interagency Steering Committee \n                established under section 405 of the SAFE Port Act, \n                that the ITDS has the operational capabilities to \n                enable users to:\n\n(i) transmit a harmonized set of import and export data elements, to be \ncollected, stored, and shared, via a secure single window, to fulfill U.S. \nGovernment requirements for the release and clearance of goods; and\n\n(ii) transition from paper-based requirements and procedures to faster and \nmore cost-effective electronic submissions to, and communications with, \nagencies;\n\n                    (c) the Board shall, in consultation with ITDS \n                participating agencies, define the standard set of data \n                elements to be collected, stored, and shared in the \n                ITDS; and continue to periodically review those data \n                elements in order to update the standard set of data \n                elements, as necessary;\n                    (d) the Board shall continue to assist the \n                Secretary of the Treasury in overseeing the \n                implementation of, and participation in, the ITDS, \n                including the establishment of the ITDS capabilities \n                and requirements associated with the collection from \n                users and distribution to relevant agencies of standard \n                electronic import and export data; and\n                    (e) the Board shall make publicly available a \n                timeline outlining the development and delivery of the \n                secure ITDS capabilities, as well as agency \n                implementation plans and schedules. Agencies shall take \n                such steps as are necessary to meet the timeline, \n                including timely completion of all appropriate \n                agreements, including memoranda of understanding, and \n                other required documents that establish procedures and \n                guidelines for the secure exchange and safeguarding of \n                data among agencies and, as appropriate, with other \n                Federal Government entities.\n\n                Sec. 4. Establishment of the Border Interagency \n                Executive Council. (a) There is established the Border \n                Interagency Executive Council (BIEC), an interagency \n                working group to be chaired by the Secretary of \n                Homeland Security or a senior-level designee from the \n                Department. The BIEC shall also have a Vice Chair, \n                selected every 2 years from among the members of the \n                BIEC by a process determined by the members. The BIEC \n                shall develop policies and processes to enhance \n                coordination across customs, transport security, health \n                and safety, sanitary, conservation, trade, and \n                phytosanitary agencies with border management \n                authorities and responsibilities to measurably improve \n                supply chain processes and improve identification of \n                illicit shipments.\n\n                    (b) The Department of Homeland Security shall \n                provide funding and administrative support for the \n                BIEC, to the extent permitted by law.\n                    (c) In addition to the Chair and Vice Chair, the \n                BIEC shall include designated senior-level \n                representatives from agencies that provide approval \n                before goods can be imported and exported, including \n                the Departments of State, the Treasury, Defense, the \n                Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Health and Human \n                Services, Transportation, and Homeland Security, the \n                Environmental Protection Agency, and other agencies \n                with border management interests or authorities, as \n                determined by the Chair and Vice Chair. The BIEC shall \n                also include appropriate representatives from the \n                Executive Office of the President.\n\n                Sec. 5. Functions of the BIEC. The BIEC shall:\n\n[[Page 10659]]\n\n                    (a) develop common risk management principles and \n                methods to inform agency operations associated with the \n                review and release of cargo at the border and encourage \n                compliance with applicable law;\n                    (b) develop policies and processes to orchestrate, \n                improve, and accelerate agency review of electronic \n                trade data transmitted through relevant systems and \n                provide coordinated and streamlined responses back to \n                users to facilitate trade and support and advance \n                compliance with applicable laws and international \n                agreements, including (in coordination with, and as \n                recommendations to, the Board) policies and processes \n                designed to assist the Secretary of the Treasury, as \n                appropriate, with activities related to the ITDS;\n                    (c) identify opportunities to streamline Federal \n                Government systems and reduce costs through the \n                elimination of redundant capabilities or through \n                enhanced utilization of the Automated Commercial \n                Environment capabilities as a means of improving supply \n                chain management processes;\n                    (d) assess, in collaboration with the Board, the \n                business need, feasibility, and potential benefits of \n                developing or encouraging the private-sector \n                development of web-based interfaces to electronic data \n                systems, including the ITDS, for individuals and small \n                businesses;\n                    (e) engage with and consider the advice of industry \n                and other relevant stakeholders regarding opportunities \n                to improve supply chain management processes, with the \n                goal of promoting economic competitiveness through \n                enhanced trade facilitation and enforcement;\n                    (f) encourage other countries to develop similar \n                single window systems to facilitate the sharing of \n                relevant data, as appropriate, across governmental \n                systems and with trading partners; and\n                    (g) assess, in consultation with the Department of \n                the Treasury, opportunities to facilitate electronic \n                payment of duties, taxes, fees, and charges due at \n                importation. The Federal Government endorses electronic \n                payment of duties, taxes, fees, and charges due at \n                importation, and currently allows payment \n                electronically through various systems.\n\n                Sec. 6. Regulatory Review. To support the Federal \n                Government's rapid development of the ITDS that, to the \n                greatest extent possible, relies upon the collection, \n                exchange, and processing of electronic data, each \n                agency that utilizes the ITDS shall:\n\n                    (a) as part of the retrospective review report due \n                to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs \n                (OIRA) on July 14, 2014, pursuant to Executive Order \n                13610 of May 10, 2012 (Identifying and Reducing \n                Regulatory Burdens), unless directed otherwise through \n                subsequent guidance from OIRA, determine whether any \n                regulations should be modified to achieve the \n                requirements set forth in this order; and\n                    (b) promptly initiate rulemaking proceedings to \n                implement necessary regulatory modifications identified \n                pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.\n\n                Sec. 7. Reports.

The Governments of Iran and Syria are \n                endeavoring to rapidly upgrade their technological \n                ability to conduct such activities. Cognizant of the \n                vital importance of providing technology that enables \n                the Iranian and Syrian people to freely communicate \n                with each other and the outside world, as well as the \n                preservation, to the extent possible, of global \n                telecommunications supply chains for essential products \n                and services to enable the free flow of information, \n                the measures in this order are designed primarily to \n                address the need to prevent entities located in whole \n                or in part in Iran and Syria from facilitating or \n                committing serious human rights abuses.

I hereby find that the unrestricted immigrant \n                and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens \n                who meet one or more of the criteria in section 1 of \n                this order would be detrimental to the interests of the \n                United States, and I hereby suspend the entry into the \n                United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of such \n                persons. Such persons shall be treated as persons \n                covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, \n                2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United \n                Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International \n                Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions).\n\n                Sec. 5.

Nothing in section 1 of this order shall \n                prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official \n                business of the United States Government by employees, \n                grantees, or contractors thereof.\n\n                Sec. 7. For the purposes of this order:\n\n                    (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or \n                entity;\n                    (b) the term ``information and communications \n                technology'' means any hardware, software, or other \n                product or service primarily intended to fulfill or \n                enable the function of information processing and \n                communication by electronic means, including \n                transmission and display, including via the Internet;\n                    (c) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, \n                association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, \n                subgroup, or other organization;\n                    (d) the term ``United States person'' means any \n                United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity \n                organized under the laws of the United States or any \n                jurisdiction within the United States (including \n                foreign branches), or any person in the United States;\n\n[[Page 24573]]\n\n                    (e) the term ``Government of Iran'' means the \n                Government of Iran, any political subdivision, agency, \n                or instrumentality thereof, including the Central Bank \n                of Iran, and any person owned or controlled by, or \n                acting for or on behalf of, the Government of Iran; and\n                    (f) the term ``Government of Syria'' means the \n                Government of the Syrian Arab Republic, its agencies, \n                instrumentalities, and controlled entities.\n\n                Sec. 8. For those persons whose property and interests \n                in property are blocked pursuant to this order who \n                might have a constitutional presence in the United \n                States, I find that because of the ability to transfer \n                funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to \n                such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this \n                order would render those measures ineffectual. I \n                therefore determine that for these measures to be \n                effective in addressing the two national emergencies \n                identified in the preamble to this order, there need be \n                no prior notice of a listing or determination made \n                pursuant to section 1 of this order.\n\n                Sec. 9. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to \n                take such actions, including the promulgation of rules \n                and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to \n                the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out \n                the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the \n                Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other \n                officers and agencies of the United States Government \n                consistent with applicable law.

Policy. The Great Lakes are a national \n                treasure constituting the largest freshwater system in \n                the world. The United States and Canada have made great \n                progress addressing past and current environmental \n                impacts to the Great Lakes ecology. The Federal \n                Government is committed to making progress on the many \n                significant challenges that remain. Along with numerous \n                State, tribal, and local programs, over 140 Federal \n                programs help fund and implement environmental \n                restoration and management activities throughout the \n                Great Lakes system. A number of intergovernmental \n                bodies are providing leadership in the region to \n                address environmental and resource management issues in \n                the Great Lakes system. These activities would benefit \n                substantially from more systematic collaboration and \n                better integration of effort. It is the policy of the \n                Federal Government to support local and regional \n                efforts to address environmental challenges and to \n                encourage local citizen and community stewardship. To \n                this end, the Federal Government will partner with the \n                Great Lakes States, tribal and local governments, \n                communities, and other interests to establish a \n                regional collaboration to address nationally \n                significant environmental and natural resource issues \n                involving the Great Lakes. It is the further policy of \n                the Federal Government that its executive departments \n                and agencies will ensure that their programs are \n                funding effective, coordinated, and environmentally \n                sound activities in the Great Lakes system.\n\n                Sec. 2.

Purpose. This order establishes an open and \n                uniform program for managing information that requires \n                safeguarding or dissemination controls pursuant to and \n                consistent with law, regulations, and Government-wide \n                policies, excluding information that is classified \n                under Executive Order 13526 of December 29, 2009, or \n                the Atomic Energy Act, as amended.\n\n                At present, executive departments and agencies \n                (agencies) employ ad hoc, agency-specific policies, \n                procedures, and markings to safeguard and control this \n                information, such as information that involves privacy, \n                security, proprietary business interests, and law \n                enforcement investigations. This inefficient, confusing \n                patchwork has resulted in inconsistent marking and \n                safeguarding of documents, led to unclear or \n                unnecessarily restrictive dissemination policies, and \n                created impediments to authorized information sharing. \n                The fact that these agency-specific policies are often \n                hidden from public view has only aggravated these \n                issues.\n\n                To address these problems, this order establishes a \n                program for managing this information, hereinafter \n                described as Controlled Unclassified Information, that \n                emphasizes the openness and uniformity of Government-\n                wide practice.\n\n                Sec. 2. Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).\n\n                    (a) The CUI categories and subcategories shall \n                serve as exclusive designations for identifying \n                unclassified information throughout the executive \n                branch that requires safeguarding or dissemination \n                controls, pursuant to and consistent with applicable \n                law, regulations, and Government-wide policies.\n                    (b) The mere fact that information is designated as \n                CUI shall not have a bearing on determinations pursuant \n                to any law requiring the disclosure of information or \n                permitting disclosure as a matter of discretion, \n                including disclosures to the legislative or judicial \n                branches.\n                    (c) The National Archives and Records \n                Administration shall serve as the Executive Agent to \n                implement this order and oversee agency actions to \n                ensure compliance with this order.\n\n                Sec. 3. Review of Current Designations.\n\n                    (a) Each agency head shall, within 180 days of the \n                date of this order:\n\n(1) review all categories, subcategories, and markings used by the agency \nto designate unclassified information for safeguarding or dissemination \ncontrols; and\n\n(2) submit to the Executive Agent a catalogue of proposed categories and \nsubcategories of CUI, and proposed associated markings for information \ndesignated as CUI under section 2(a) of this order. This submission shall \nprovide definitions for each proposed category and subcategory and identify \nthe basis in law, regulation, or Government-wide policy for safeguarding or \ndissemination controls.\n\n                    (b) If there is significant doubt about whether \n                information should be designated as CUI, it shall not \n                be so designated.\n\n                Sec. 4. Development of CUI Categories and Policies.\n\n[[Page 68676]]\n\n                    (a) On the basis of the submissions under section 3 \n                of this order or future proposals, and in consultation \n                with affected agencies, the Executive Agent shall, in a \n                timely manner, approve categories and subcategories of \n                CUI and associated markings to be applied uniformly \n                throughout the executive branch and to become effective \n                upon publication in the registry established under \n                subsection (d) of this section. No unclassified \n                information meeting the requirements of section 2(a) of \n                this order shall be disapproved for inclusion as CUI, \n                but the Executive Agent may resolve conflicts among \n                categories and subcategories of CUI to achieve \n                uniformity and may determine the markings to be used.\n                    (b) The Executive Agent, in consultation with \n                affected agencies, shall develop and issue such \n                directives as are necessary to implement this order. \n                Such directives shall be made available to the public \n                and shall provide policies and procedures concerning \n                marking, safeguarding, dissemination, and decontrol of \n                CUI that, to the extent practicable and permitted by \n                law, regulation, and Government-wide policies, shall \n                remain consistent across categories and subcategories \n                of CUI and throughout the executive branch. In \n                developing such directives, appropriate consideration \n                should be given to the report of the interagency Task \n                Force on Controlled Unclassified Information published \n                in August 2009. The Executive Agent shall issue initial \n                directives for the implementation of this order within \n                180 days of the date of this order.\n                    (c) The Executive Agent shall convene and chair \n                interagency meetings to discuss matters pertaining to \n                the program established by this order.\n                    (d) Within 1 year of the date of this order, the \n                Executive Agent shall establish and maintain a public \n                CUI registry reflecting authorized CUI categories and \n                subcategories, associated markings, and applicable \n                safeguarding, dissemination, and decontrol procedures.\n                    (e) If the Executive Agent and an agency cannot \n                reach agreement on an issue related to the \n                implementation of this order, that issue may be \n                appealed to the President through the Director of the \n                Office of Management and Budget.\n                    (f) In performing its functions under this order, \n                the Executive Agent, in accordance with applicable law, \n                shall consult with representatives of the public and \n                State, local, tribal, and private sector partners on \n                matters related to approving categories and \n                subcategories of CUI and developing implementing \n                directives issued by the Executive Agent pursuant to \n                this order.\n\n                Sec. 5. Implementation.\n\n                    (a) Within 180 days of the issuance of initial \n                policies and procedures by the Executive Agent in \n                accordance with section 4(b) of this order, each agency \n                that originates or handles CUI shall provide the \n                Executive Agent with a proposed plan for compliance \n                with the requirements of this order, including the \n                establishment of interim target dates.\n                    (b) After a review of agency plans, and in \n                consultation with affected agencies and the Office of \n                Management and Budget, the Executive Agent shall \n                establish deadlines for phased implementation by \n                agencies.\n                    (c) In each of the first 5 years following the date \n                of this order and biennially thereafter, the Executive \n                Agent shall publish a report on the status of agency \n                implementation of this order.\n\n                Sec. 6.

(a) All property and interests in property \n                that are in the United States, that hereafter come \n                within the United States, or that are or hereafter come \n                within the possession or control of any United States \n                person (including any foreign branch) of the following \n                persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, \n                exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:\n\n(i) the persons listed in the Annex to this order; and\n\n(ii) persons determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \nwith the Secretary of State:\n\n  (A) to be an official of the Government of the Russian Federation;\n\n  (B) to operate in the arms or related materiel sector in the Russian \nFederation;\n\n  (C) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act \nfor or on behalf of, directly or indirectly:\n\n(1) a senior official of the Government of the Russian Federation; or\n\n(2) a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant \nto this order; or\n\n  (D) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, \nmaterial, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in \nsupport of:\n\n(1) a senior official of the Government of the Russian Federation; or\n\n(2) a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant \nto this order.\n\n                    (b) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this \n                section apply except to the extent provided by \n                statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or \n                licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and \n                notwithstanding any contract entered into or any \n                license or permit granted prior to the effective date \n                of this order.\n\n                Sec. 2. I hereby find that the unrestricted immigrant \n                and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens \n                determined to meet one or more of the criteria in \n                section 1(a) of this order would be detrimental to the \n                interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend \n                entry into the United\n\n[[Page 15536]]\n\n                States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of such \n                persons. Such persons shall be treated as persons \n                covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, \n                2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United \n                Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International \n                Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions).\n\n                Sec. 3. I hereby determine that the making of donations \n                of the type of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) \n                of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the \n                benefit of any person whose property and interests in \n                property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this \n                order would seriously impair my ability to deal with \n                the national emergency declared in Executive Order \n                13660, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided \n                by section 1 of this order.\n\n                Sec. 4. The prohibitions in section 1 of this order \n                include but are not limited to:\n\n                    (a) the making of any contribution or provision of \n                funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of \n                any person whose property and interests in property are \n                blocked pursuant to this order; and\n                    (b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of \n                funds, goods, or services from any such person.\n\n                Sec. 5. (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has \n                the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation \n                of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set \n                forth in this order is prohibited.\n\n                    (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the \n                prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.\n\n                Sec. 6. For the purposes of this order:\n\n                    (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or \n                entity;\n                    (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, \n                association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, \n                subgroup, or other organization;\n                    (c) the term ``United States person'' means any \n                United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity \n                organized under the laws of the United States or any \n                jurisdiction within the United States (including \n                foreign branches), or any person in the United States; \n                and\n                    (d) the term the ``Government of the Russian \n                Federation'' means the Government of the Russian \n                Federation, any political subdivision, agency, or \n                instrumentality thereof, including the Central Bank of \n                the Government of the Russian Federation, and any \n                person owned or controlled by, or acting for or on \n                behalf of, the Government of the Russian Federation.\n\n                Sec. 7. For those persons whose property and interests \n                in property are blocked pursuant to this order who \n                might have a constitutional presence in the United \n                States, I find that because of the ability to transfer \n                funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to \n                such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this \n                order would render those measures ineffectual. I \n                therefore determine that for these measures to be \n                effective in addressing the national emergency declared \n                in Executive Order 13660, there need be no prior notice \n                of a listing or determination made pursuant to section \n                1 of this order.\n\n                Sec. 8. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to \n                take such actions, including the promulgation of rules \n                and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to \n                the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to carry \n                out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the \n                Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other \n                officers and agencies of the United States Government \n                consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the \n                United States Government are hereby directed to take \n                all appropriate measures within their authority to \n                carry out the provisions of this order.\n\n                Sec. 9. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to \n                determine that circumstances no longer warrant the \n                blocking of the property and interests in property of a \n                person\n\n[[Page 15537]]\n\n                listed in the Annex to this order, and to take \n                necessary action to give effect to that determination.\n\n                Sec. 10. This order is not intended to, and does not, \n                create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, \n                enforceable at law or in equity by any party against \n                the United States, its departments, agencies, or \n                entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any \n                other person.\n\n                Sec. 11. This order is effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern \n                daylight time on March 17, 2014.\n                &lt;GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT&gt;\n                \n                    (Presidential Sig.)\n\n                THE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n                    March 16, 2014.\n\nBilling code 3295-F4-P\n\n\n\n[[Page 15538]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TD19MR14.008\n\n\n[FR Doc. 2014-06141\nFiled 3-18-14;

Purpose. The Gulf Coast is a national \n                treasure. Its natural resources are an important \n                economic engine for the entire United States; its \n                waters sustain a diverse and vibrant ecosystem; and the \n                Gulf's culture, natural beauty, and historic \n                significance are unique. Each year, millions of \n                tourists visit the Gulf to vacation, swim, boat, fish, \n                hunt, and bird-watch; and, together, the Gulf's tourism \n                and commercial and recreational fishing industries make \n                a significant contribution to the United States \n                economy. More than 90 percent of the Nation's offshore \n                oil and gas is produced in the Gulf, and it is where \n                nearly one-third of seafood production in the \n                continental United States is harvested.\n\n                The United States needs a vibrant Gulf Coast, and the \n                Federal Government is committed to helping Gulf Coast \n                residents conserve and restore resilient and healthy \n                ecosystems in the Gulf of Mexico and surrounding \n                regions that support the diverse economies, \n                communities, and cultures of the region. To effectively \n                address the damage caused by the BP Deepwater Horizon \n                Oil Spill, address the longstanding ecological decline, \n                and begin moving toward a more resilient Gulf Coast \n                ecosystem, ecosystem restoration is needed. Ecosystem \n                restoration will support economic vitality, enhance \n                human health and safety, protect infrastructure, enable \n                communities to better withstand impact from storms and \n                climate change, sustain safe seafood and clean water, \n                provide recreational and cultural opportunities, \n                protect and preserve sites that are of historical and \n                cultural significance, and contribute to the overall \n                resilience of our coastal communities and Nation.\n\n                In order to achieve these objectives, it is necessary \n                that Federal efforts be efficiently integrated with \n                those of local stakeholders and that particular focus \n                be given to innovative solutions and complex, large-\n                scale restoration projects. Efforts must be science-\n                based and well-coordinated to minimize duplication and \n                ensure effective delivery of services. This order \n                establishes a Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Task \n                Force to coordinate intergovernmental responsibilities, \n                planning, and exchange of information so as to better \n                implement Gulf Coast ecosystem restoration and to \n                facilitate appropriate accountability and support \n                throughout the restoration process.\n\n                Sec. 2.

Policy. Since September 11, 2001, more than \n                two million service members have deployed to Iraq or \n                Afghanistan. Long deployments and intense combat \n                conditions require optimal support for the emotional \n                and mental health needs of our service members and \n                their families. The need for mental health services \n                will only increase in the coming years as the Nation \n                deals with the effects of more than a decade of \n                conflict. Reiterating and expanding upon the commitment \n                outlined in my Administration's 2011 report, entitled \n                ``Strengthening Our Military Families,'' we have an \n                obligation to evaluate our progress and continue to \n                build an integrated network of support capable of \n                providing effective mental health services for \n                veterans, service members, and their families. Our \n                public health approach must encompass the practices of \n                disease prevention and the promotion of good health for \n                all military populations throughout their lifespans, \n                both within the health care systems of the Departments \n                of Defense and Veterans Affairs and in local \n                communities. Our efforts also must focus on both \n                outreach to veterans and their families and the \n                provision of high quality mental health treatment to \n                those in need. Coordination between the Departments of \n                Veterans Affairs and Defense during service members' \n                transition to civilian life is essential to achieving \n                these goals.\n\n                Ensuring that all veterans, service members (Active, \n                Guard, and Reserve alike), and their families receive \n                the support they deserve is a top priority for my \n                Administration. As part of our ongoing efforts to \n                improve all facets of military mental health, this \n                order directs the Secretaries of Defense, Health and \n                Human Services, Education, Veterans Affairs, and \n                Homeland Security to expand suicide prevention \n                strategies and take steps to meet the current and \n                future demand for mental health and substance abuse \n                treatment services for veterans, service members, and \n                their families.\n\n                Sec. 2. Suicide Prevention. (a) By December 31, 2012, \n                the Department of Veterans Affairs, in continued \n                collaboration with the Department of Health and Human \n                Services, shall expand the capacity of the Veterans \n                Crisis Line by 50 percent to ensure that veterans have \n                timely access, including by telephone, text, or online \n                chat, to qualified, caring responders who can help \n                address immediate crises and direct veterans to \n                appropriate care. Further, the Department of Veterans \n                Affairs shall ensure that any veteran identifying him \n                or herself as being in crisis connects with a mental \n                health professional or trained mental health worker \n                within 24 hours. The Department of Veterans Affairs \n                also shall expand the number of mental health \n                professionals who are available to see veterans beyond \n                traditional business hours.\n\n                    (b) The Departments of Veterans Affairs and Defense \n                shall jointly develop and implement a national suicide \n                prevention campaign focused on connecting veterans and \n                service members to mental health services. This 12-\n                month campaign, which shall begin on September 1, 2012, \n                will focus on the positive benefits of seeking care and \n                encourage veterans and service members to proactively \n                reach out to support services.\n                    (c) To provide the best mental health and substance \n                abuse prevention, education, and outreach support to \n                our military and their family members,\n\n[[Page 54784]]\n\n                the Department of Defense shall review all of its \n                existing mental health and substance abuse prevention, \n                education, and outreach programs across the military \n                services and the Defense Health Program to identify the \n                key program areas that produce the greatest impact on \n                quality and outcomes, and rank programs within each of \n                these program areas using metrics that assess their \n                effectiveness. By the end of Fiscal Year 2014, existing \n                program resources shall be realigned to ensure that \n                highly ranked programs are implemented across all of \n                the military services and less effective programs are \n                replaced.\n\n                Sec. 3. Enhanced Partnerships Between the Department of \n                Veterans Affairs and Community Providers. (a) Within \n                180 days of the date of this order, in those service \n                areas where the Department of Veterans Affairs has \n                faced challenges in hiring and placing mental health \n                service providers and continues to have unfilled \n                vacancies or long wait times, the Departments of \n                Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services shall \n                establish pilot projects whereby the Department of \n                Veterans Affairs contracts or develops formal \n                arrangements with community-based providers, such as \n                community mental health clinics, community health \n                centers, substance abuse treatment facilities, and \n                rural health clinics, to test the effectiveness of \n                community partnerships in helping to meet the mental \n                health needs of veterans in a timely way. Pilot sites \n                shall ensure that consumers of community-based services \n                continue to be integrated into the health care systems \n                of the Department of Veterans Affairs. No fewer than 15 \n                pilot projects shall be established.\n\n                    (b) The Department of Veterans Affairs shall \n                develop guidance for its medical centers and service \n                networks that supports the use of community mental \n                health services, including telehealth services and \n                substance abuse services, where appropriate, to meet \n                demand and facilitate access to care. This guidance \n                shall include recommendations that medical centers and \n                service networks use community-based providers to help \n                meet veterans' mental health needs where objective \n                criteria, which the Department of Veterans Affairs \n                shall define in the form of specific metrics, \n                demonstrate such needs. Such objective criteria should \n                include estimates of wait-times for needed care that \n                exceed established targets.\n                    (c) The Departments of Health and Human Services \n                and Veterans Affairs shall develop a plan for a rural \n                mental health recruitment initiative to promote \n                opportunities for the Department of Veterans Affairs \n                and rural communities to share mental health providers \n                when demand is insufficient for either the Department \n                of Veterans Affairs or the communities to independently \n                support a full-time provider.\n\n                Sec. 4. Expanded Department of Veterans Affairs Mental \n                Health Services Staffing. The Secretary of Veterans \n                Affairs shall, by December 31, 2013, hire and train 800 \n                peer-to-peer counselors to empower veterans to support \n                other veterans and help meet mental health care needs. \n                In addition, the Secretary shall continue to use all \n                appropriate tools, including collaborative arrangements \n                with community-based providers, pay-setting \n                authorities, loan repayment and scholarships, and \n                partnerships with health care workforce training \n                programs to accomplish the Department of Veterans \n                Affairs' goal of recruiting, hiring, and placing 1,600 \n                mental health professionals by June 30, 2013. The \n                Department of Veterans Affairs also shall evaluate the \n                reporting requirements associated with providing mental \n                health services and reduce paperwork requirements where \n                appropriate. In addition, the Department of Veterans \n                Affairs shall update its management performance \n                evaluation system to link performance to meeting mental \n                health service demand.\n\n                Sec. 5. Improved Research and Development. (a) The lack \n                of full understanding of the underlying mechanisms of \n                Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), other mental \n                health conditions, and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) has \n                hampered progress in prevention, diagnosis, and \n                treatment. In order to improve the coordination of \n                agency research into these conditions and reduce the \n                number of affected men and women through better \n                prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, the Departments \n                of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Health and Human \n                Services, and Education, in coordination with the \n                Office of\n\n[[Page 54785]]\n\n                Science and Technology Policy, shall establish a \n                National Research Action Plan within 8 months of the \n                date of this order.\n\n                    (b) The National Research Action Plan shall include \n                strategies to establish surrogate and clinically \n                actionable biomarkers for early diagnosis and treatment \n                effectiveness; develop improved diagnostic criteria for \n                TBI; enhance our understanding of the mechanisms \n                responsible for PTSD, related injuries, and \n                neurological disorders following TBI; foster \n                development of new treatments for these conditions \n                based on a better understanding of the underlying \n                mechanisms; improve data sharing between agencies and \n                academic and industry researchers to accelerate \n                progress and reduce redundant efforts without \n                compromising privacy; and make better use of electronic \n                health records to gain insight into the risk and \n                mitigation of PTSD, TBI, and related injuries. In \n                addition, the National Research Action Plan shall \n                include strategies to support collaborative research to \n                address suicide prevention.\n                    (c) The Departments of Defense and Health and Human \n                Services shall engage in a comprehensive longitudinal \n                mental health study with an emphasis on PTSD, TBI, and \n                related injuries to develop better prevention, \n                diagnosis, and treatment options. Agencies shall \n                continue ongoing collaborative research efforts, with \n                an aim to enroll at least 100,000 service members by \n                December 31, 2012, and include a plan for long-term \n                follow-up with enrollees through a coordinated effort \n                with the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\n                Sec. 6. Military and Veterans Mental Health Interagency \n                Task Force. There is established an Interagency Task \n                Force on Military and Veterans Mental Health (Task \n                Force), to be co-chaired by the Secretaries of Defense, \n                Veterans Affairs, and Health and Human Services, or \n                their designated representatives.\n\n                    (a) Membership. In addition to the Co-Chairs, the \n                Task Force shall consist of representatives from:\n\n(i) the Department of Education;\n\n(ii) the Office of Management and Budget;\n\n(iii) the Domestic Policy Council;\n\n(iv) the National Security Staff;\n\n(v) the Office of Science and Technology Policy;\n\n(vi) the Office of National Drug Control Policy; and\n\n(vii) such other executive departments, agencies, or offices as the Co-\nChairs may designate.\n\n                A member agency of the Task Force shall designate a \n                full-time officer or employee of the Federal Government \n                to perform the Task Force functions.\n\n                    (b) Mission. Member agencies shall review relevant \n                statutes, policies, and agency training and guidance to \n                identify reforms and take actions that facilitate \n                implementation of the strategies outlined in this \n                order. Member agencies shall work collaboratively on \n                these strategies and also create an inventory of mental \n                health and substance abuse programs and activities to \n                inform this work.\n                    (c)  Functions.\n\n(i) Not later than 180 days after the date of this order, the Task Force \nshall submit recommendations to the President on strategies to improve \nmental health and substance abuse treatment services for veterans, service \nmembers, and their families. Every year thereafter, the Task Force shall \nprovide to the President a review of agency actions to enhance mental \nhealth and substance abuse treatment services for veterans, service \nmembers, and their families consistent with this order, as well as provide \nadditional recommendations for action as appropriate. The Task Force shall \ndefine specific goals and metrics that will aid in measuring progress in \nimproving mental health strategies. The Task Force will include cost \nanalysis in the development of all recommendations, and will ensure any new \nrequirements are supported within existing resources.\n\n[[Page 54786]]\n\n(ii) In addition to coordinating and reviewing agency efforts to enhance \nveteran and military mental health services pursuant to this order, the \nTask Force shall evaluate:\n\n(1) agency efforts to improve care quality and ensure that the Departments \nof Defense and Veterans Affairs and community-based mental health providers \nare trained in the most current evidence-based methodologies for treating \nPTSD, TBI, depression, related mental health conditions, and substance \nabuse;\n\n(2) agency efforts to improve awareness and reduce stigma for those needing \nto seek care; and\n\n(3) agency research efforts to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and \ntreatment of TBI, PTSD, and related injuries, and explore the need for an \nexternal research portfolio review.\n\n(iii) In performing its functions, the Task Force shall consult with \nrelevant nongovernmental experts and organizations as necessary.\n\n                Sec. 7.

The \n                creation of a new whole-of-government commercial \n                advocacy task force that will provide enhanced Federal \n                support for U.S. businesses competing for international \n                contracts, coordinate the efforts of executive branch \n                leadership in engaging their foreign counterparts on \n                commercial advocacy issues, and increase the \n                availability of information to the U.S. business \n                community about these kinds of export opportunities, \n                will ensure that U.S. exporters have more support for \n                selling their goods and services in global markets.\n\n                Sec. 2.

The prohibitions in section 1 of this order \n                apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in \n                regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may \n                be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding \n                any contract entered into or any license or permit \n                granted prior to the effective date of this order.\n\n                Sec. 5.

For the purposes of this order:\n\n                    (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or \n                entity;\n                    (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, \n                association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, \n                subgroup, or other organization;\n                    (c) the term ``United States person'' means any \n                United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity \n                organized under the laws of the United States or any \n                jurisdiction within the United States (including \n                foreign branches), or any person in the United States; \n                and\n                    (d) the term ``Government of Syria'' means the \n                Government of the Syrian Arab Republic, its agencies, \n                instrumentalities, and controlled entities.\n\n                Sec. 7. For those persons whose property and interests \n                in property are blocked pursuant to this order who \n                might have a constitutional presence in the United \n                States, I find that because of the ability to transfer \n                funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to \n                such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this \n                order would render those measures ineffectual. I \n                therefore determine that for these measures to be \n                effective in addressing the national emergency declared \n                in Executive Order 13338 and expanded in scope in \n                Executive Order 13572, there need be no prior notice of \n                a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 \n                of this order.\n\n                Sec. 8. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to \n                take such actions, including the promulgation of rules \n                and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to \n                the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out \n                the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the \n                Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other \n                officers and agencies of the United States Government \n                consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the \n                United States Government are hereby directed to take \n                all appropriate measures within their authority to \n                carry out the provisions of this order.\n\n                Sec. 9. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to \n                determine that circumstances no longer warrant the \n                blocking of the property and interests in property of a \n                person listed in the Annex to this order, and to take \n                necessary action to give effect to that determination.\n\n                Sec. 10.

Policy. My Administration is committed to \n                ensuring that the Federal Government serves the \n                American people with the utmost effectiveness and \n                efficiency. Over the last 2 years, we have made good \n                progress and have saved taxpayer dollars by cutting \n                waste and increasing the efficiency of Government \n                operations by curbing uncontrolled growth in contract \n                spending, terminating poorly performing information \n                technology projects, deploying state of the art fraud \n                detection tools to crack down on waste, focusing agency \n                leaders on achieving ambitious improvements in high \n                priority areas, and opening Government up to the public \n                to increase accountability and accelerate innovation.\n\n                The American people must be able to trust that their \n                Government is doing everything in its power to stop \n                wasteful practices and earn a high return on every tax \n                dollar that is spent. To strengthen that trust and \n                deliver a smarter and leaner Government, my \n                Administration will reinforce the performance and \n                management reform gains achieved thus far; \n                systematically identify additional reforms necessary to \n                eliminate wasteful, duplicative, or otherwise \n                inefficient programs; and publicize these reforms so \n                that they may serve as a model across the Federal \n                Government.\n\n                The implementation of the American Recovery and \n                Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5) (Recovery \n                Act) has seen unprecedented transparency. The Recovery \n                Accountability and Transparency Board (RATB) has \n                developed innovative technologies and approaches for \n                preventing and identifying fraud and abuse that have \n                the potential to improve performance across all of \n                Government spending.\n\n                Sec. 2. Accountable Government Initiative. (a) On \n                September 14, 2010, in a Memorandum to the Senior \n                Executive Service, my Administration introduced goals \n                for the Accountable Government Initiative (Initiative). \n                The mission of the Initiative is to monitor and promote \n                agency progress in making Government work better, \n                faster, and more efficiently. To hold executive \n                departments and agencies (agencies) accountable for \n                obtaining results consistent with this mission, the \n                Vice President shall convene periodic meetings in which \n                Cabinet members and the Director of the Office of \n                Management and Budget (OMB) report to him on \n                improvements implemented under their direction.\n\n                    (b) The Federal Chief Performance Officer (CPO), \n                who also serves as the Deputy Director for Management \n                of OMB and the Chair of the President's Management \n                Council (PMC), shall work with the PMC to support \n                agencies' performance and management reform and cost-\n                cutting efforts. The CPO will lead OMB and the PMC in \n                identifying practices that should be adopted across \n                agencies and in facilitating reforms that require \n                cross-agency coordination and cooperation. The CPO \n                shall work with agencies to ensure that each area \n                identified as critical to performance improvement has \n                robust performance metrics in place, and that these \n                metrics are frequently analyzed\n\n[[Page 35298]]\n\n                and reviewed by agency leadership. Agencies shall \n                update these metrics quarterly, as appropriate, on the \n                website <a href=\"http://performance.gov\">performance.gov</a>.\n                    (c) In accordance with the GPRA Modernization Act \n                of 2010 (31 U.S.C. 1115 et seq.), each agency's Chief \n                Operating Officer (COO) shall be designated as the \n                Senior Accountable Official responsible for leading \n                performance and management reform efforts, and for \n                reducing wasteful or ineffective programs, policies, \n                and procedures. In discharging this responsibility, \n                this official shall be accountable for conducting \n                frequent data-driven reviews of agency progress toward \n                goals in the areas that OMB identifies as being \n                critical to performance improvement across agencies or \n                that the agency head identifies as top near-term \n                priorities. These goals may include reforming \n                information technology, reducing improper payments, \n                leveraging the Federal Government's purchasing scale, \n                reducing high-risk contracting practices, improving the \n                management of Federal real estate, enhancing customer \n                service, and achieving agency and Federal Government \n                priority goals identified pursuant to the GPRA \n                Modernization Act of 2010.\n                    (d) The Director of OMB shall provide guidance to \n                agencies as part of the Fiscal Year 2013 budget process \n                for identifying areas of program overlap and \n                duplication within and across agencies, and for \n                proposing consolidations and reductions to address \n                those inefficiencies.\n                    (e) The Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) at all \n                agencies shall be responsible for achieving agency cost \n                savings. This will include each agency's share of the \n                $2.1 billion in administrative cost savings identified \n                in my Fiscal Year 2012 Budget, and for achieving those \n                savings as quickly as possible. The CFOs are encouraged \n                to realize these cost savings by targeting wasteful \n                practices and by reducing, and identifying alternatives \n                to, discretionary travel, the use of consultants, and \n                other administrative expenses. The Federal CFO Council \n                shall provide a monthly report on these efforts to the \n                PMC, with relevant findings and progress reported on \n                <a href=\"http://performance.gov\">performance.gov</a>.\n\n                Sec. 3. Government Accountability and Transparency \n                Board. (a) There is hereby established a Government \n                Accountability and Transparency Board (Board) to \n                provide strategic direction for enhancing the \n                transparency of Federal spending and advance efforts to \n                detect and remediate fraud, waste, and abuse in Federal \n                programs. The Board shall be composed of 11 members \n                designated by the President from among agency \n                Inspectors General, agency Chief Financial Officers or \n                Deputy Secretaries, a senior official of OMB, and such \n                other members as the President shall designate. The \n                President shall designate a Chair from among the \n                members.

While the U.S. Government's \n                credit, debit, and other payment card programs already \n                include protections against fraud, the Government must \n                further strengthen the security of consumer data and \n                encourage the adoption of enhanced safeguards \n                nationwide in a manner that protects privacy and \n                confidentiality while maintaining an efficient and \n                innovative financial system.\n\n                By the authority vested in me as President by the \n                Constitution and the laws of the United States of \n                America, and in order to improve the security of \n                consumer financial transactions in both the private and \n                public sectors, it is hereby ordered as follows:\n\n                Section 1. Secure Government Payments. In order to \n                strengthen data security and thereby better protect \n                citizens doing business with the Government, executive \n                departments and agencies (agencies) shall, as soon as \n                possible, transition payment processing terminals and \n                credit, debit, and other payment cards to employ \n                enhanced security features, including chip-and-PIN \n                technology. In determining enhanced security features \n                to employ, agencies shall consider relevant voluntary \n                consensus standards and specifications, as appropriate, \n                consistent with the National Technology Transfer and \n                Advancement Act of 1995 and Office of Management and \n                Budget Circular A-119.\n\n                    (a) The Secretary of the Treasury shall take \n                necessary steps to ensure that payment processing \n                terminals acquired by agencies through the Department \n                of the Treasury or through alternative means authorized \n                by the Department of the Treasury have enhanced \n                security features. No later than January 1, 2015, all \n                new payment processing terminals acquired in these ways \n                shall include hardware necessary to support such \n                enhanced security features. By January 1, 2015, the \n                Department of the Treasury shall develop a plan for \n                agencies to install enabling software that supports \n                enhanced security features.\n                    (b) The Administrator of General Services shall \n                take necessary steps to ensure that credit, debit, and \n                other payment cards provided through General Services \n                Administration (GSA) contracts have enhanced security \n                features, and shall begin replacing credit, debit, and \n                other payment cards without enhanced security features \n                no later than January 1, 2015.\n                    (c) The Secretary of the Treasury shall take \n                necessary steps to ensure that Direct Express prepaid \n                debit cards for administering Government benefits have \n                enhanced security features, and by January 1, 2015, the \n                Department of the Treasury shall develop a plan for the \n                replacement of Direct Express prepaid debit cards \n                without enhanced security features.\n                    (d) By January 1, 2015, other agencies with credit, \n                debit, and other payment card programs shall provide to \n                the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) plans for \n                ensuring that their credit, debit, and other payment \n                cards have enhanced security features.\n                    (e) Nothing in this order shall be construed to \n                preclude agencies from adopting additional standards or \n                upgrading to more effective technology\n\n[[Page 63492]]\n\n                and standards to improve the security of consumer \n                financial transactions as technologies and threats \n                evolve.\n\n                Sec. 2. Improved Identity Theft Remediation. To reduce \n                the burden on consumers who have been victims of \n                identity theft, including by substantially reducing the \n                amount of time necessary for a consumer to remediate \n                typical incidents:\n\n                    (a) by February 15, 2015, the Attorney General, in \n                coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security, \n                shall issue guidance to promote regular submissions, as \n                appropriate and permitted by law, by Federal law \n                enforcement agencies of compromised credentials to the \n                National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance's \n                Internet Fraud Alert System;\n                    (b) the Department of Justice, the Department of \n                Commerce, and the Social Security Administration shall \n                identify all publicly available agency resources for \n                victims of identity theft, and shall provide to the \n                Federal Trade Commission (FTC) information about such \n                resources no later than March 15, 2015, with updates \n                thereafter as necessary. These agencies shall work in \n                consultation with the FTC to streamline these resources \n                and consolidate them wherever possible at the FTC's \n                public Web site, <a href=\"http://IdentityTheft.gov\">IdentityTheft.gov</a>; and\n                    (c) OMB and GSA shall assist the FTC in enhancing \n                the functionality of <a href=\"http://IdentityTheft.gov\">IdentityTheft.gov</a>, including by \n                coordinating with the credit bureaus to streamline the \n                reporting and remediation process with credit bureaus' \n                systems to the extent feasible, and in making the \n                enhanced site available to the public by May 15, 2015.\n\n                Sec. 3.  Securing Federal Transactions Online. To help \n                ensure that sensitive data are shared only with the \n                appropriate person or people, within 90 days of the \n                date of this order, the National Security Council \n                staff, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and \n                OMB shall present to the President a plan, consistent \n                with the guidance set forth in the 2011 National \n                Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace, to \n                ensure that all agencies making personal data \n                accessible to citizens through digital applications \n                require the use of multiple factors of authentication \n                and an effective identity proofing process, as \n                appropriate. Within 18 months of the date of this \n                order, relevant agencies shall complete any required \n                implementation steps set forth in the plan prepared \n                pursuant to this section.\n\n                Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) This order shall be \n                implemented consistent with applicable law and subject \n                to the availability of appropriations.\n\n                    (b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to \n                impair or otherwise affect:\n\n                      (i) the authority granted by law to an executive \n                    department, agency, or the head thereof; or\n                      (ii) the functions of the Director of OMB \n                    relating to budgetary, administrative, or \n                    legislative proposals.\n\n[[Page 63493]]\n\n                    (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, \n                create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, \n                enforceable at law or in equity by any party against \n                the United States, its departments, agencies, or \n                entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any \n                other person.\n                &lt;GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT&gt;\n                \n                    (Presidential Sig.)\n\n                THE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n                    October 17, 2014.\n\n[FR Doc. 2014-25439\nFiled 10-22-14; 11:15 am]\nBilling code 3295-F5\n\n\n</pre>]","url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2014/10/23/2014-25439/improving-the-security-of-consumer-financial-transactions","president":"obama","id":"13681"},"reftime":1418257693289}

(IEEPA), the \n                National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) \n                (NEA), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,\n\n                I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of \n                America, find that Colonel Muammar Qadhafi, his \n                government, and close associates have taken extreme \n                measures against the people of Libya, including by \n                using weapons of war, mercenaries, and wanton violence \n                against unarmed civilians. I further find that there is \n                a serious risk that Libyan state assets will be \n                misappropriated by Qadhafi, members of his government, \n                members of his family, or his close associates if those \n                assets are not protected. The foregoing circumstances, \n                the prolonged attacks, and the increased numbers of \n                Libyans seeking refuge in other countries from the \n                attacks, have caused a deterioration in the security of \n                Libya and pose a serious risk to its stability, thereby \n                constituting an unusual and extraordinary threat to the \n                national security and foreign policy of the United \n                States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to \n                deal with that threat.\n\n                I hereby order:\n\n                Section 1. All property and interests in property that \n                are in the United States, that hereafter come within \n                the United States, or that are or hereafter come within \n                the possession or control of any United States person, \n                including any overseas branch, of the following persons \n                are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, \n                withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:\n\n                    (a) the persons listed in the Annex to this order; \n                and\n                    (b) any person determined by the Secretary of the \n                Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State:\n\n(i) to be a senior official of the Government of Libya;\n\n(ii) to be a child of Colonel Muammar Qadhafi;\n\n(iii) to be responsible for or complicit in, or responsible for ordering, \ncontrolling, or otherwise directing, or to have participated in, the \ncommission of human rights abuses related to political repression in Libya;\n\n(iv) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, \nmaterial, logistical, or technical support for, or goods or services in \nsupport of the activities described in subsection (b)(iii) of this section \nor any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant \nto this order;\n\n(v) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for \nor on behalf of, any person whose property and interests in property are \nblocked pursuant to this order; or\n\n(vi) to be a spouse or dependent child of any person whose property and \ninterests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.\n\n                Sec. 2.

For those persons whose property and interests \n                in property are blocked pursuant to this order who \n                might have a constitutional presence in the United \n                States, I find that because of the ability to transfer \n                funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to \n                such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this \n                order would render those measures ineffectual. I \n                therefore determine that for these measures to be \n                effective in addressing the national emergency declared \n                in this order, there need be no prior notice of a \n                listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of \n                this order.\n\n                Sec. 4. I hereby determine that, to the extent section \n                203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) may apply, \n                the making of donations of the type of articles \n                specified in such section by, to, or for the benefit of \n                any person whose property and interests in property are \n                blocked pursuant to sections 1 and 2 of this order \n                would seriously impair my ability to deal with the \n                national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby \n                prohibit such donations as provided by sections 1 and 2 \n                of this order.\n\n                Sec. 5.

The prohibitions in sections 1 and 2 of this \n                order apply except to the extent provided by statutes, \n                or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that \n                may be issued pursuant to this order, and \n                notwithstanding any contract entered into or any \n                license or permit granted prior to the effective date \n                of this order.\n\n                Sec. 7. (a) Any transaction by a United States person \n                or within the United States that evades or avoids, has \n                the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation \n                of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set \n                forth in this order is prohibited.\n\n                    (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the \n                prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.\n\n                Sec. 8. Nothing in this order shall prohibit \n                transactions for the conduct of the official business \n                of the Federal Government by employees, grantees, or \n                contractors thereof.\n\n                Sec. 9.

The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to \n                take such actions, including the promulgation of rules \n                and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to \n                the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out \n                the purposes of this order.

The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to \n                determine that circumstances no longer warrant the \n                blocking of the property and interests in property of a \n                person listed in the Annex to this order, and to take \n                necessary action to give effect to that determination.\n\n                Sec. 12.

Over a party's \nobjection, the military judge may authorize any witness to testify on \ninterlocutory questions via remote means or similar technology if the \npractical difficulties of producing the witness outweigh the significance \nof the witness' personal appearance (although such testimony will not be \nadmissible over the accused's objection as evidence on the ultimate issue \nof guilt). Factors to be considered include, but are not limited to, the \ncosts of producing the witness; the timing of the request for production of \nthe witness; the potential delay in the interlocutory proceeding that may \nbe caused by the production of the witness; the willingness of the witness \nto testify in person; the likelihood of significant interference with \nmilitary operational deployment, mission accomplishment, or essential \ntraining; and, for child witnesses, the traumatic effect of providing in-\ncourt testimony.''\n\n(b) R.C.M. 804 is amended by redesignating paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) as \nparagraphs (c), (d), and (e), respectively, and inserting the following new \nparagraph (b):\n\n``(b) Presence by remote means.

The accused's absence will be conditional upon his being \nable to view the witness' testimony from a remote location. Normally, \ntransmission of the testimony will include a system that will transmit the \naccused's image and voice into the courtroom from a remote location as well \nas transmission of the child's testimony from the courtroom to the \naccused's location. A one-way transmission may be used if deemed necessary \nby the military judge. The accused will also be provided private,\n\n[[Page 20214]]\n\ncontemporaneous communication with his counsel.

Explanation.\n\n(1) Nature of offense. This article makes it a separate, punishable crime \nto cause the death of or bodily injury to an unborn child while engaged in \narson (article 126, UCMJ); murder (article 118, UCMJ); voluntary \nmanslaughter (article 119(a), UCMJ); involuntary manslaughter (article \n119(b)(2), UCMJ); rape (article 120(a), UCMJ); robbery (article 122, UCMJ); \nmaiming (article 124, UCMJ); or assault (article 128, UCMJ) against a \npregnant woman.

(IEEPA), the \n                National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) \n                (NEA), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,\n\n                I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of \n                America, find that the activities of significant \n                transnational criminal organizations, such as those \n                listed in the Annex to this order, have reached such \n                scope and gravity that they threaten the stability of \n                international political and economic systems. Such \n                organizations are becoming increasingly sophisticated \n                and dangerous to the United States; they are \n                increasingly entrenched in the operations of foreign \n                governments and the international financial system, \n                thereby weakening democratic institutions, degrading \n                the rule of law, and undermining economic markets. \n                These organizations facilitate and aggravate violent \n                civil conflicts and increasingly facilitate the \n                activities of other dangerous persons. I therefore \n                determine that significant transnational criminal \n                organizations constitute an unusual and extraordinary \n                threat to the national security, foreign policy, and \n                economy of the United States, and hereby declare a \n                national emergency to deal with that threat.\n\n                Accordingly, I hereby order:\n\n                Section 1. (a) All property and interests in property \n                that are in the United States, that hereafter come \n                within the United States, or that are or hereafter come \n                within the possession or control of any United States \n                person, including any overseas branch, of the following \n                persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, \n                exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:\n\n(i) the persons listed in the Annex to this order and\n\n(ii) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in \nconsultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State:\n\n  (A) to be a foreign person that constitutes a significant transnational \ncriminal organization;\n\n  (B) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, \nmaterial, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in \nsupport of, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked \npursuant to this order; or\n\n  (C) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act \nfor or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and \ninterests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.\n\n                    (b) I hereby determine that the making of donations \n                of the types of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) \n                of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the \n                benefit of any person whose property and interests in \n                property are blocked pursuant to this order would \n                seriously impair my ability to deal with the national \n                emergency declared in this order, and I hereby prohibit \n                such donations as provided by subsection (a) of this \n                section.\n                    (c) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this \n                section include, but are not limited to:\n\n[[Page 44758]]\n\n(i) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or \nservices by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and \ninterests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and\n\n(ii) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or \nservices from any such person.\n\n                    (d) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this \n                section apply except to the extent provided by \n                statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or \n                licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and \n                notwithstanding any contract entered into or any \n                license or permit granted prior to the effective date \n                of this order.\n\n                Sec. 2.

For the purposes of this order:\n\n                    (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or \n                entity;\n                    (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, \n                association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, \n                subgroup, or other organization;\n                    (c) the term ``United States person'' means any \n                United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity \n                organized under the laws of the United States or any \n                jurisdiction within the United States (including \n                foreign branches), or any person in the United States;\n                    (d) the term ``foreign person'' means any citizen \n                or national of a foreign state, or any entity organized \n                under the laws of a foreign state or existing in a \n                foreign state, including any such individual or entity \n                who is also a United States person; and\n                    (e) the term ``significant transnational criminal \n                organization'' means a group of persons, such as those \n                listed in the Annex to this order, that includes one or \n                more foreign persons; that engages in an ongoing \n                pattern of serious criminal activity involving the \n                jurisdictions of at least two foreign states; and that \n                threatens the national security, foreign policy, or \n                economy of the United States.\n\n                Sec. 4. For those persons whose property and interests \n                in property are blocked pursuant to this order who \n                might have a constitutional presence in the United \n                States, I find that because of the ability to transfer \n                funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to \n                such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this \n                order would render these measures ineffectual. I \n                therefore determine that for these measures to be \n                effective in addressing the national emergency declared \n                in this order, there need be no prior notice of a \n                listing or determination made pursuant to section 1(a) \n                of this order.\n\n                Sec. 5.

The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any \n                of these functions to other officers and agencies of \n                the United States Government consistent with applicable \n                law. All agencies of the United States Government are \n                hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within \n                their authority to carry out the provisions of this \n                order.\n\n                Sec. 6.

The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, \n                is hereby authorized to determine that\n\n[[Page 44759]]\n\n                circumstances no longer warrant the blocking of the \n                property and interests in property of a person listed \n                in the Annex to this order, and to take necessary \n                action to give effect to that determination.\n\n                Sec. 8. This order is not intended to, and does not, \n                create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, \n                enforceable at law or in equity by any party against \n                the United States, its departments, agencies, or \n                entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any \n                other person.\n\n                Sec. 9.

For those persons whose property and interests \n                in property are blocked pursuant to this order who \n                might have a constitutional presence in the United \n                States, I find that because of the ability to transfer \n                funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to \n                such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this \n                order would render those measures ineffectual. I \n                therefore determine that for these measures to be \n                effective in addressing the national emergency declared \n                in Executive Order 12957, there need be no prior notice \n                of a listing or determination made pursuant to section \n                1 of this order.\n\n                Sec. 9.

The Secretary of the Treasury \n                may redelegate any of these functions and authorities \n                to other officers and agencies of the United States \n                Government consistent with applicable law.\n\n[[Page 6661]]\n\n                All agencies of the United States Government are hereby \n                directed to take all appropriate measures within their \n                authority to carry out the provisions of this order.\n\n                Sec. 10.

Policy. My Administration is committed to \n                cutting waste in Federal Government spending and \n                identifying opportunities to promote efficient and \n                effective spending. The Federal Government performs \n                critical functions that support the basic protections \n                that Americans have counted on for decades. As they \n                serve taxpayers, executive departments and agencies \n                (agencies) also must act in a fiscally responsible \n                manner, including by minimizing their costs, in order \n                to perform these mission-critical functions in the most \n                efficient, cost-effective way. As such, I have pursued \n                an aggressive agenda for reducing administrative costs \n                since taking office and, most recently, within my \n                Fiscal Year 2012 Budget. Building on this effort, I \n                direct agency heads to take even more aggressive steps \n                to ensure the Government is a good steward of taxpayer \n                money.\n\n                Sec. 2. Agency Reduction Targets. Each agency shall \n                establish a plan for reducing the combined costs \n                associated with the activities covered by sections 3 \n                through 7 of this order, as well as activities included \n                in the Administrative Efficiency Initiative in the \n                Fiscal Year 2012 Budget, by not less than 20 percent \n                below Fiscal Year 2010 levels, in Fiscal Year 2013. \n                Agency plans for meeting this target shall be submitted \n                to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) within 45 \n                days of the date of this order. The OMB shall monitor \n                implementation of these plans consistent with Executive \n                Order 13576 of June 13, 2011 (Delivering an Efficient, \n                Effective, and Accountable Government).\n\n                Sec. 3. Travel. (a) Agency travel is important to the \n                effective functioning of Government and certain \n                activities can be performed only by traveling to a \n                different location. However, to ensure efficient travel \n                spending, agencies are encouraged to devise strategic \n                alternatives to Government travel, including local or \n                technological alternatives, such as teleconferencing \n                and video-conferencing. Agencies should make all \n                appropriate efforts to conduct business and host or \n                sponsor conferences in space controlled by the Federal \n                Government, wherever practicable and cost-effective. \n                Lastly, each agency should review its policies \n                associated with domestic civilian permanent change of \n                duty station travel (relocations), including \n                eligibility rules, to identify ways to reduce costs and \n                ensure appropriate controls are in place.\n\n                    (b) Each agency, agency component, and office of \n                inspector general should designate a senior-level \n                official to be responsible for developing and \n                implementing policies and controls to ensure efficient \n                spending on travel and conference-related activities, \n                consistent with subsection (a) of this section.\n\n                Sec. 4. Employee Information Technology Devices. \n                Agencies should assess current device inventories and \n                usage, and establish controls, to ensure that they are \n                not paying for unused or underutilized information \n                technology (IT) equipment, installed software, or \n                services. Each agency should take steps to limit the \n                number of IT devices (e.g., mobile phones, smartphones, \n                desktop and laptop computers, and tablet personal \n                computers) issued to employees, consistent with the \n                Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-292), \n                operational requirements (including continuity of \n                operations), and initiatives designed to create \n                efficiency through the effective implementation of \n                technology. To promote further efficiencies in IT, \n                agencies should\n\n[[Page 70864]]\n\n                consider the implementation of appropriate agency-wide \n                IT solutions that consolidate activities such as \n                desktop services, email, and collaboration tools.\n\n                Sec. 5. Printing. Agencies are encouraged to limit the \n                publication and printing of hard copy documents and to \n                presume that information should be provided in an \n                electronic form, whenever practicable, permitted by \n                law, and consistent with applicable records retention \n                requirements. Agencies should consider using \n                acquisition vehicles developed by the OMB's Federal \n                Strategic Sourcing Initiative to acquire printing and \n                copying devices and services.\n\n                Sec. 6. Executive Fleet Efficiencies. The President's \n                Memorandum of May 24, 2011 (Federal Fleet Performance) \n                directed agencies to improve the performance of the \n                Federal fleet of motor vehicles by increasing the use \n                of vehicle technologies, optimizing fleet size, and \n                improving agency fleet management. Building upon this \n                effort, agencies should limit executive transportation.\n\n                Sec. 7. Extraneous Promotional Items.

For the purposes of this order:\n\n                (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;\n\n                (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, \n                association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, \n                subgroup, or other organization; and\n\n                (c) the term ``United States person'' means any United \n                States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity \n                organized under the laws of the United States or any \n                jurisdiction within the United States (including \n                foreign branches), or any person in the United States.\n\n                Sec. 4. For those persons whose property and interests \n                in property are blocked pursuant to this order who \n                might have a constitutional presence in the United \n                States, I find that, because of the ability to transfer \n                funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to \n                such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this \n                order would render these measures ineffectual. I \n                therefore determine that, for these measures to be \n                effective in addressing the national emergency declared \n                in this order, there need be no prior notice of a \n                listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of \n                this order.\n\n                Sec. 5.

The Secretary of the \n                Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other \n                officers and agencies of the United States Government, \n                consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the \n                United States Government are hereby directed to take \n                all appropriate measures within their authority to \n                carry out the provisions of this order and, where \n                appropriate, to advise the Secretary of the Treasury in \n                a timely manner of the measures taken.

All agencies of the \n                United States Government are hereby directed to take \n                all appropriate measures within their authority to \n                carry out the provisions of this order.\n\n                Sec. 10. This order is not intended to, and does not, \n                create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, \n                enforceable at law or in equity by any party against \n                the United States, its departments, agencies, or \n                entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any \n                other person.\n\n                Sec. 11.

Policy. To contribute to the Nation's future \n                financial stability and increase upward economic \n                mobility, it is the policy of the Federal Government to \n                promote financial capability among young Americans and \n                encourage building the financial capability of young \n                people at an early stage in schools, families, \n                communities, and the workplace. By starting early, \n                young people can begin to learn the difference between \n                wants and needs, the importance and power of saving, \n                and the positive and productive role money can play in \n                their lives. Having a basic understanding of money \n                management from an early age will make our young people \n                better equipped to tackle more complex financial \n                decisions in their transition to adulthood, when \n                critical decisions about financing higher education and \n                saving for retirement can have lasting consequences for \n                financial security. Strengthening the financial \n                capability of our young people is an investment in our \n                Nation's economic prosperity.\n\n                Financial capability is the capacity, based on \n                knowledge, skills, and access, to manage financial \n                resources prudently and effectively. Efforts to improve \n                financial capability, which should be based on evidence \n                of effectiveness, empower individuals to make informed \n                choices, plan and set goals, avoid pitfalls, know where \n                to seek help, and take other actions to better their \n                present and long-term financial well-being.\n\n                Sec. 2. Establishment of the Council. There is \n                established within the Department of the Treasury the \n                President's Advisory Council on Financial Capability \n                for Young Americans (Council).\n\n                Sec. 3.

The composition of the Council \n                shall reflect the views of diverse stakeholders.\n                    (c) The Secretary shall invite the Director of the \n                Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection to participate \n                as a member of the Council, to the extent consistent \n                with the Bureau's statutory authorities and legal \n                obligations.\n                    (d) The President shall designate a Chair and a \n                Vice Chair from among the members of the Council \n                appointed pursuant to subsection (a)(ii) of this \n                section.\n\n[[Page 39160]]\n\n                    (e) Subject to the direction of the Secretary, the \n                Chair shall convene and preside at meetings of the \n                Council, determine its agenda, direct its work, and, as \n                appropriate to deal with particular subjects, establish \n                and direct the work of subgroups of the Council that \n                shall consist exclusively of members of the Council.\n                    (f) The Vice Chair shall perform:\n\n(i) the duties of the Chair when the position of Chair is vacant; and\n\n(ii) such other functions as the Chair may from time to time assign.\n\n                Sec. 4.

Administration of the Council. (a) To the \n                extent permitted by law, the Department of the Treasury \n                shall provide funding and administrative support for \n                the Council, as determined by the Secretary, to \n                implement this order.\n\n[[Page 39161]]\n\n                    (b) The heads of agencies shall provide, as \n                appropriate and to the extent permitted by law, such \n                assistance and information to the Council as the \n                Secretary may request to implement this order.\n                    (c) Members of the Council appointed under section \n                3(a)(ii) of this order shall serve without any \n                compensation for their work on the Council.\n                    (d) Members of the Council, while engaged in the \n                work of the Council, may be allowed travel expenses, \n                including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as \n                authorized by law for persons serving intermittently in \n                Government service (5 U.S.C. 5701-5707), consistent \n                with the availability of funds.\n                    (e) The Secretary shall designate an official \n                within the Department of the Treasury to serve as an \n                Executive Director to supervise the administrative \n                support for the Council.\n\n                Sec. 6.

The poaching of protected species \n                and the illegal trade in wildlife and their derivative \n                parts and products (together known as ``wildlife \n                trafficking'') represent an international crisis that \n                continues to escalate. Poaching operations have \n                expanded beyond small-scale, opportunistic actions to \n                coordinated slaughter commissioned by armed and \n                organized criminal syndicates. The survival of \n                protected wildlife species such as elephants, rhinos, \n                great apes, tigers, sharks, tuna, and turtles has \n                beneficial economic, social, and environmental impacts \n                that are important to all nations. Wildlife trafficking \n                reduces those benefits while generating billions of \n                dollars in illicit revenues each year, contributing to \n                the illegal economy, fueling instability, and \n                undermining security. Also, the prevention of \n                trafficking of live animals helps us control the spread \n                of emerging infectious diseases. For these reasons, it \n                is in the national interest of the United States to \n                combat wildlife trafficking.\n\n                In order to enhance domestic efforts to combat wildlife \n                trafficking, to assist foreign nations in building \n                capacity to combat wildlife trafficking, and to assist \n                in combating transnational organized crime, executive \n                departments and agencies (agencies) shall take all \n                appropriate actions within their authority, including \n                the promulgation of rules and regulations and the \n                provision of technical and financial assistance, to \n                combat wildlife trafficking in accordance with the \n                following objectives:\n\n                    (a) in appropriate cases, the United States shall \n                seek to assist those governments in anti-wildlife \n                trafficking activities when requested by foreign \n                nations experiencing trafficking of protected wildlife;\n                    (b) the United States shall promote and encourage \n                the development and enforcement by foreign nations of \n                effective laws to prohibit the illegal taking of, and \n                trade in, these species and to prosecute those who \n                engage in wildlife trafficking, including by building \n                capacity;\n                    (c) in concert with the international community and \n                partner organizations, the United States shall seek to \n                combat wildlife trafficking; and\n                    (d) the United States shall seek to reduce the \n                demand for illegally traded wildlife, both at home and \n                abroad, while allowing legal and legitimate commerce \n                involving wildlife.\n\n                Sec. 2.

(a) This order shall be \n                implemented consistent with applicable domestic and \n                international law, and subject to the availability of \n                appropriations.\n\n                    (b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to \n                impair or otherwise affect:\n\n[[Page 40623]]\n\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the \nhead thereof, or the status of that department or agency within the Federal \nGovernment; or\n\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget \nrelating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n                    (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, \n                create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, \n                enforceable at law or in equity by any party against \n                the United States, its departments, agencies, or \n                entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any \n                other person.\n                    (d) Insofar as the Federal Advisory Committee Act, \n                as amended (5 U.S.C.

Policy. The original GI Bill, approved just \n                weeks after D-Day, educated nearly 8 million Americans \n                and helped transform this Nation. We owe the same \n                obligations to this generation of service men and women \n                as was afforded that previous one. This is the promise \n                of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of \n                2008 (title V, Public Law 110-252) (Post-9/11 GI Bill) \n                and the continued provision of educational benefits in \n                the Department of Defense's Tuition Assistance Program \n                (10 U.S.C. 2007): to provide our service members, \n                veterans, spouses, and other family members the \n                opportunity to pursue a high-quality education and gain \n                the skills and training they need to fill the jobs of \n                tomorrow.\n\n                Since the Post-9/11 GI Bill became law, there have been \n                reports of aggressive and deceptive targeting of \n                service members, veterans, and their families by some \n                educational institutions. For example, some \n                institutions have recruited veterans with serious brain \n                injuries and emotional vulnerabilities without \n                providing academic support and counseling; encouraged \n                service members and veterans to take out costly \n                institutional loans rather than encouraging them to \n                apply for Federal student loans first; engaged in \n                misleading recruiting practices on military \n                installations; and failed to disclose meaningful \n                information that allows potential students to determine \n                whether the institution has a good record of graduating \n                service members, veterans, and their families and \n                positioning them for success in the workforce.\n\n                To ensure our service members, veterans, spouses, and \n                other family members have the information they need to \n                make informed decisions concerning their well-earned \n                Federal military and veterans educational benefits, I \n                am directing my Administration to develop Principles of \n                Excellence to strengthen oversight, enforcement, and \n                accountability within these benefits programs.\n\n                Sec. 2. Principles of Excellence for Educational \n                Institutions Serving Service Members, Veterans, \n                Spouses, and Other Family Members. The Departments of \n                Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Education shall \n                establish Principles of Excellence (Principles) to \n                apply to educational institutions receiving funding \n                from Federal military and veterans educational benefits \n                programs, including benefits programs provided by the \n                Post-9/11 GI Bill and the Tuition Assistance Program. \n                The Principles should ensure that these educational \n                institutions provide meaningful information to service \n                members, veterans, spouses, and other family members \n                about the financial cost and quality of educational \n                institutions to assist those prospective students in \n                making choices about how to use their Federal \n                educational benefits;

To the extent practicable, the \n                student outcome measures should rely on existing \n                administrative data to minimize the reporting burden on \n                institutions participating in these benefit programs. \n                The student outcome measures should permit comparisons \n                across Federal educational programs and across \n                institutions and types of institutions.

The Secretaries of Defense and Veterans \n                Affairs shall also ensure that service members and \n                veterans have access to that information through \n                educational counseling offered by those Departments.\n\n                Sec. 4. Strengthening Enforcement and Compliance \n                Mechanisms. Service members, veterans, spouses, and \n                other family members should have access to a strong \n                enforcement system through which to file complaints \n                when institutions fail to follow the Principles. Within \n                90 days of the date of this order, the Secretaries of \n                Defense and Veterans Affairs, in consultation with the \n                Secretary of Education and the Director of the CFPB, as \n                well as with the Attorney General, as appropriate, \n                shall submit to the President a plan to strengthen \n                enforcement and compliance mechanisms. The plan shall \n                include proposals to:\n\n                    (a) create a centralized complaint system for \n                students receiving Federal military and veterans \n                educational benefits to register complaints that can be \n                tracked and responded to by the Departments of Defense, \n                Veterans Affairs, Justice, and Education, the CFPB, and \n                other relevant agencies;\n                    (b) institute uniform procedures for receiving and \n                processing complaints across the State Approving \n                Agencies (SAAs) that work with the Department of \n                Veterans Affairs to review participating institutions, \n                provide a coordinated mechanism across SAAs to alert \n                the Department of Veterans Affairs to any complaints \n                that have been registered at the State level, and \n                create procedures for sharing information about \n                complaints with the appropriate State officials, \n                accrediting agency representatives, and the Secretary \n                of Education;\n                    (c) institute uniform procedures for referring \n                potential matters for civil or criminal enforcement to \n                the Department of Justice and other relevant agencies;\n                    (d) establish procedures for targeted risk-based \n                program reviews of institutions to ensure compliance \n                with the Principles;\n\n[[Page 25864]]\n\n                    (e) establish new uniform rules and strengthen \n                existing procedures for access to military \n                installations by educational institutions. These new \n                rules should ensure, at a minimum, that only those \n                institutions that enter into a memorandum of agreement \n                pursuant to section 3(a) of this order are permitted \n                entry onto a Federal military installation for the \n                purposes of recruitment. The Department of Defense \n                shall include specific steps for instructing \n                installation commanders on commercial solicitation \n                rules and the requirement of the Principles outlined in \n                section 2(c) of this order; and\n                    (f) take all appropriate steps to ensure that \n                websites and programs are not deceptively and \n                fraudulently marketing educational services and \n                benefits to program beneficiaries, including initiating \n                a process to protect the term ``GI Bill'' and other \n                military or veterans-related terms as trademarks, as \n                appropriate.\n\n                Sec. 5.

For the purposes of this order:\n\n                    (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or \n                entity;\n                    (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, \n                association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, \n                subgroup, or other organization; and\n                    (c) the term ``United States person'' means any \n                United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity \n                organized under the laws of the United States or any \n                jurisdiction within the United States (including \n                foreign branches), or any person in the United States.\n\n                Sec. 8.

I \n                therefore determine that for these measures to be \n                effective in addressing the national emergency declared \n                in this order, there need be no prior notice of a \n                listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of \n                this order.\n\n                Sec. 9. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to \n                take such actions, including the promulgation of rules \n                and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to \n                the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out \n                the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the \n                Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other \n                officers and agencies of the United States Government \n                consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the \n                United States Government are hereby directed to take \n                all appropriate measures within their authority to \n                carry out the provisions of this order.\n\n                Sec. 10.

Policy. Over the course of America's \n                history, African American men and women have \n                strengthened our Nation, including by leading reforms, \n                overcoming obstacles, and breaking down barriers. In \n                the less than 60 years since the Brown v. Board of \n                Education decision put America on a path toward equal \n                educational opportunity, America's educational system \n                has undergone a remarkable transformation, and many \n                African American children who attended the substandard \n                segregated schools of the 1950s have grown up to see \n                their children attend integrated elementary and \n                secondary schools, colleges, and universities.\n\n                However, substantial obstacles to equal educational \n                opportunity still remain in America's educational \n                system. African Americans lack equal access to highly \n                effective teachers and principals, safe schools, and \n                challenging college-preparatory classes, and they \n                disproportionately experience school discipline and \n                referrals to special education. African American \n                student achievement not only lags behind that of their \n                domestic peers by an average of two grade levels, but \n                also behind students in almost every other developed \n                nation. Over a third of African American students do \n                not graduate from high school on time with a regular \n                high school diploma, and only four percent of African \n                American high school graduates interested in college \n                are college-ready across a range of subjects. An even \n                greater number of African American males do not \n                graduate with a regular high school diploma, and \n                African American males also experience disparate rates \n                of incarceration.\n\n                Significantly improving the educational outcomes of \n                African Americans will provide substantial benefits for \n                our country by, among other things, increasing college \n                completion rates, productivity, employment rates, and \n                the number of African American teachers. Enhanced \n                educational outcomes lead to more productive careers, \n                improved economic opportunity, and greater social well-\n                being for all Americans. Complementing the role of \n                Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in \n                preparing generations of African American students for \n                successful careers, and the work of my Administration's \n                separate White House Initiative on Historically Black \n                Colleges and Universities, this new Initiative's focus \n                on improving all the sequential levels of education \n                will produce a more effective educational continuum for \n                all African American students.\n\n                To reach the ambitious education goals we have set for \n                our Nation, as well as to ensure equality of access and \n                opportunity for all, we must provide the support that \n                will enable African American students to improve their \n                level of educational achievement through rigorous and \n                well-rounded academic and support services that will \n                prepare them for college, a career, and a lifetime of \n                learning.\n\n[[Page 45472]]\n\n                Sec. 2.

Policy. The purpose of this order is to \n                maximize the Federal Government's ability to develop \n                local partnerships in the United States to support \n                homeland security priorities. Partnerships are \n                collaborative working relationships in which the goals, \n                structure, and roles and responsibilities of the \n                relationships are mutually determined. Collaboration \n                enables the Federal Government and its partners to use \n                resources more efficiently, build on one another's \n                expertise, drive innovation, engage in collective \n                action, broaden investments to achieve shared goals, \n                and improve performance. Partnerships enhance our \n                ability to address homeland security priorities, from \n                responding to natural disasters to preventing \n                terrorism, by utilizing diverse perspectives, skills, \n                tools, and resources.\n\n                The National Security Strategy emphasizes the \n                importance of partnerships, underscoring that to keep \n                our Nation safe ``we must tap the ingenuity outside \n                government through strategic partnerships with the \n                private sector, nongovernmental organizations, \n                foundations, and community-based organizations. Such \n                partnerships are critical to U.S. success at home and \n                abroad, and we will support them through enhanced \n                opportunities for engagement, coordination, \n                transparency, and information sharing.'' This approach \n                recognizes that, given the complexities and range of \n                challenges, we must institutionalize an all-of-Nation \n                effort to address the evolving threats to the United \n                States.\n\n                Sec. 2.

Policy. This order seeks to increase \n                efficiency and cost savings in the work performed by \n                parties who contract with the Federal Government by \n                increasing to $10.10 the hourly minimum wage paid by \n                those contractors. Raising the pay of low-wage workers \n                increases their morale and the productivity and quality \n                of their work, lowers turnover and its accompanying \n                costs, and reduces supervisory costs. These savings and \n                quality improvements will lead to improved economy and \n                efficiency in Government procurement.\n\n                Sec. 2. Establishing a minimum wage for Federal \n                contractors and subcontractors. (a) Executive \n                departments and agencies (agencies) shall, to the \n                extent permitted by law, ensure that new contracts, \n                contract-like instruments, and solicitations \n                (collectively referred to as ``contracts''), as \n                described in section 7 of this order, include a clause, \n                which the contractor and any subcontractors shall \n                incorporate into lower-tier subcontracts, specifying, \n                as a condition of payment, that the minimum wage to be \n                paid to workers, including workers whose wages are \n                calculated pursuant to special certificates issued \n                under 29 U.S.C. 214(c), in the performance of the \n                contract or any subcontract thereunder, shall be at \n                least:\n\n(i) $10.10 per hour beginning January 1, 2015; and\n\n(ii) beginning January 1, 2016, and annually thereafter, an amount \ndetermined by the Secretary of Labor (Secretary). The amount shall be \npublished by the Secretary at least 90 days before such new minimum wage is \nto take effect and shall be:\n\n  (A) not less than the amount in effect on the date of such determination;\n\n  (B) increased from such amount by the annual percentage increase in the \nConsumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (United \nStates city average, all items, not seasonally adjusted), or its successor \npublication, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; and\n\n  (C) rounded to the nearest multiple of $0.05.\n\n                    (b) In calculating the annual percentage increase \n                in the Consumer Price Index for purposes of subsection \n                (a)(ii)(B) of this section, the Secretary shall compare \n                such Consumer Price Index for the most recent month, \n                quarter, or year available (as selected by the \n                Secretary prior to the first year for which a minimum \n                wage is in effect pursuant to subsection (a)(ii)(B)) \n                with the Consumer Price Index for the same month in the \n                preceding year, the same quarter in the preceding year, \n                or the preceding year, respectively.\n                    (c) Nothing in this order shall excuse \n                noncompliance with any applicable Federal or State \n                prevailing wage law, or any applicable law or municipal \n                ordinance establishing a minimum wage higher than the \n                minimum wage established under this order.\n\n                Sec. 3. Application to tipped workers.

Regulations and Implementation. (a) The \n                Secretary shall issue regulations by October 1, 2014, \n                to the extent permitted by law and consistent with the \n                requirements of the Federal Property and Administrative \n                Services Act, to implement the requirements of this \n                order, including providing exclusions from the \n                requirements set forth in this order where appropriate. \n                To the extent permitted by law, within 60 days of the \n                Secretary issuing such regulations, the Federal \n                Acquisition Regulatory Council shall issue regulations \n                in the Federal Acquisition Regulation to provide for \n                inclusion of the contract clause in Federal procurement \n                solicitations and contracts subject to this order.\n\n                    (b) Within 60 days of the Secretary issuing \n                regulations pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, \n                agencies shall take steps, to the extent permitted by \n                law, to exercise any applicable authority to ensure \n                that contracts as described in section 7(d)(i)(C) and \n                (D) of this order, entered into after January 1, 2015, \n                consistent with the effective date of such agency \n                action, comply with the requirements set forth in \n                sections 2 and 3 of this order.\n                    (c) Any regulations issued pursuant to this section \n                should, to the extent practicable and consistent with \n                section 8 of this order, incorporate existing \n                definitions, procedures, remedies, and enforcement \n                processes under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. \n                201 et seq.; the Service Contract Act, 41 U.S.C. 6701 \n                et seq.; and the Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C. 3141 et \n                seq.\n\n                Sec. 5.

Policy. (a) Recognizing that gender-based \n                violence undermines not only the safety, dignity, and \n                human rights of the millions of individuals who \n                experience it, but also the public health, economic \n                stability, and security of nations, it is the policy \n                and practice of the executive branch of the United \n                States Government to have a multi-year strategy that \n                will more effectively prevent and respond to gender-\n                based violence globally.\n\n                    (b) Under the leadership of my Administration, the \n                United States has made gender equality and women's \n                empowerment a core focus of our foreign policy. This \n                focus is reflected in our National Security Strategy, \n                the Presidential Policy Directive on Global \n                Development, and the 2010 U.S. Quadrennial Diplomacy \n                and Development Review. Evidence demonstrates that \n                women's empowerment is critical to building stable, \n                democratic societies; to supporting open and \n                accountable governance; to furthering international \n                peace and security; to growing vibrant market \n                economies; and to addressing pressing health and \n                education challenges.\n                    (c) Preventing and responding to gender-based \n                violence is a cornerstone of my Administration's \n                commitment to advance gender equality and women's \n                empowerment. Such violence significantly hinders the \n                ability of individuals to fully participate in, and \n                contribute to, their communities--economically, \n                politically, and socially. It is a human rights \n                violation or abuse; a public health challenge; and a \n                barrier to civic, social, political, and economic \n                participation. It is associated with adverse health \n                outcomes, limited access to education, increased costs \n                relating to medical and legal services, lost household \n                productivity, and reduced income, and there is evidence \n                it is exacerbated in times of crisis, such as \n                emergencies, natural disasters, and violent conflicts.\n                    (d) The executive branch multi-year strategy for \n                preventing and responding to gender-based violence is \n                set forth in the United States Strategy to Prevent and \n                Respond to Gender-based Violence Globally (Strategy). \n                The Strategy both responds to and expands upon the \n                request in section 7061 of House conference report 112-\n                331 accompanying the Department of State, Foreign \n                Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, \n                2012 (Division I of Public Law 112-74), for the \n                executive branch to develop a multi-year strategy to \n                prevent and respond to violence against women and girls \n                in countries where it is common.\n\n                Sec. 2. Creating an Interagency Working Group. There is \n                established an Interagency Working Group (Working \n                Group) to address gender-based violence, which shall \n                coordinate implementation of the Strategy by the \n                executive departments and agencies that are members of \n                the Working Group (member agencies) in accordance with \n                the priorities set forth in section 3 of this order.\n\n                    (a) The Working Group shall be co-chaired by the \n                Secretary of State and the Administrator of the United \n                States Agency for International Development (Co-\n                Chairs). In addition to the Co-Chairs, the Working \n                Group shall consist of representatives from:\n\n(i) the Department of the Treasury;\n\n[[Page 49346]]\n\n(ii) the Department of Defense;\n\n(iii) the Department of Justice;\n\n(iv) the Department of Labor;\n\n(v) the Department of Health and Human Services;\n\n(vi) the Department of Homeland Security;\n\n(vii) the Office of Management and Budget;\n\n(viii) the National Security Staff;\n\n(ix) the Office of the Vice President;\n\n(x) the Peace Corps;\n\n(xi) the Millennium Challenge Corporation;\n\n(xii) the White House Council on Women and Girls; and\n\n(xiii) other executive departments, agencies, and offices, as designated by \nthe Co-Chairs.\n\n                    (b) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the \n                Co-Chairs shall convene the first meeting of the \n                Working Group to:\n\n(i) establish benchmarks to implement the Strategy; and\n\n(ii) determine a timetable for periodically reviewing those benchmarks.\n\n                    (c) Within 18 months of the date of this order, the \n                Working Group shall complete a progress report for \n                submission to the Co-Chairs evaluating the U.S. \n                Government's implementation of the Strategy.\n                    (d) Within 3 years of the date of this order, the \n                Working Group shall complete a final evaluation for \n                submission to the Co-Chairs of the U.S. Government's \n                implementation of the Strategy.\n                    (e) Within 180 days of completing its final \n                evaluation of the Strategy in accordance with \n                subsection (d) of this section, the Working Group shall \n                update or revise the Strategy to take into account the \n                information learned and the progress made during and \n                through the implementation of the Strategy.\n                    (f) The activities of the Working Group shall, \n                consistent with law, take due account of existing \n                interagency bodies and coordination mechanisms and will \n                coordinate with such bodies and mechanisms where \n                appropriate in order to avoid duplication of efforts.\n\n                Sec. 3. Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-based \n                Violence Globally. Member agencies shall implement the \n                Strategy to prevent and respond to gender-based \n                violence globally based on the following priorities \n                reflected in the Strategy:\n\n                    (a) Increasing Coordination of Gender-based \n                Violence Prevention and Response Efforts Among U.S. \n                Government Agencies and with Other Stakeholders.\n\n(i) Member agencies shall draw upon each other's expertise, responsibility, \nand capacity to provide a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach to \nissues relating to gender-based violence.\n\n(ii) Member agencies shall deepen engagement and coordination with other \ngovernments; international organizations, including multilateral and \nbilateral actors; the private sector; and civil society organizations, such \nas representatives of indigenous and marginalized groups, foundations, \ncommunity-based, faith-based, and regional organizations (including those \nthat serve survivors), labor unions, universities, and research \norganizations. The Working Group shall consider a range of mechanisms by \nwhich these stakeholders may provide input to the U.S. Government on its \nrole in preventing and responding to gender-based violence globally.\n\n                    (b) Enhancing Integration of Gender-based Violence \n                Prevention and Response Efforts into Existing U.S. \n                Government Work. Member agencies shall more \n                comprehensively integrate gender-based violence \n                prevention and response programming into their foreign \n                policy and foreign assistance efforts. This integration \n                shall also build on current efforts that address \n                gender-based violence, such as the U.S. National Action \n                Plan on Women, Peace, and Security; the Global Health \n                Initiative; the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS \n                Relief; the U.S. Government's work to counter \n                trafficking in persons;\n\n[[Page 49347]]\n\n                and the U.S. Government's humanitarian response \n                efforts. The Working Group shall coordinate these \n                different efforts as they relate to gender-based \n                violence to leverage the most effective programs and to \n                avoid duplication.\n                    (c) Improving Collection, Analysis, and Use of Data \n                and Research to Enhance Gender-based Violence \n                Prevention and Response Efforts. Member agencies shall \n                work to promote ethical and safe research, data \n                collection, and evidence-based analyses relating to \n                different forms of gender-based violence and prevention \n                and response efforts at the country and local level. \n                This work will include the development of a research \n                agenda that assesses agencies' research and data \n                collection capabilities, needs, and gaps; builds upon \n                existing data and research; and is coordinated with the \n                work of other organizations that are prioritizing \n                global gender-based violence research. Member agencies \n                shall prioritize the monitoring and evaluation of \n                gender-based violence prevention and response \n                interventions to determine their effectiveness. Member \n                agencies shall systematically identify and share best \n                practices, lessons learned, and research within and \n                across agencies. Member agencies, as appropriate, shall \n                seek to develop public-private partnerships to support \n                U.S. Government research initiatives and strategic \n                planning efforts.\n                    (d)  Enhancing or Expanding U.S. Government \n                Programming that Addresses Gender-based Violence. \n                Consistent with the availability of appropriations, the \n                U.S. Government shall support programming that provides \n                a comprehensive and multi-sector approach to preventing \n                and responding to gender-based violence; shall consider \n                replicating or expanding successful programs; and shall \n                assess the feasibility of a focused, coordinated, \n                comprehensive, and multi-sector approach to gender-\n                based violence in one or more countries.\n\n                Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order \n                shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the \nhead thereof; or\n\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget \nrelating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n                    (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with \n                applicable law and subject to the availability of \n                appropriations.\n                    (c) Independent agencies are strongly encouraged to \n                comply with this order.\n\n[[Page 49348]]\n\n                    (d) This order is not intended to, and does not, \n                create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, \n                enforceable at law or in equity by any party against \n                the United States, its departments, agencies, or \n                entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any \n                other person.\n                &lt;GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT&gt;\n                \n                    (Presidential Sig.)\n\n                THE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n                    Washington, August 10, 2012.\n\n[FR Doc. 2012-20259\nFiled 8-15-12; 8:45 am]\nBilling code 3295-F2-P\n\n\n</pre>]","url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2012/08/16/2012-20259/preventing-and-responding-to-violence-against-women-and-girls-globally","president":"obama","id":"13623"},"reftime":1418257685041}

Policy. The United States recognizes a \n                government-to-government relationship, as well as a \n                unique legal and political relationship, with federally \n                recognized tribes. This relationship is set forth in \n                the Constitution of the United States, treaties, \n                statutes, Executive Orders, administrative rules and \n                regulations, and judicial decisions. Honoring these \n                relationships and respecting the sovereignty of tribal \n                nations is critical to advancing tribal self-\n                determination and prosperity.\n\n                As we work together to forge a brighter future for all \n                Americans, we cannot ignore a history of mistreatment \n                and destructive policies that have hurt tribal \n                communities. The United States seeks to continue \n                restoring and healing relations with Native Americans \n                and to strengthen its partnership with tribal \n                governments, for our more recent history demonstrates \n                that tribal self-determination--the ability of tribal \n                governments to determine how to build and sustain their \n                own communities--is necessary for successful and \n                prospering communities. We further recognize that \n                restoring tribal lands through appropriate means helps \n                foster tribal self-determination.\n\n                This order establishes a national policy to ensure that \n                the Federal Government engages in a true and lasting \n                government-to-government relationship with federally \n                recognized tribes in a more coordinated and effective \n                manner, including by better carrying out its trust \n                responsibilities. This policy is established as a means \n                of promoting and sustaining prosperous and resilient \n                tribal communities. Greater engagement and meaningful \n                consultation with tribes is of paramount importance in \n                developing any policies affecting tribal nations.\n\n                To honor treaties and recognize tribes' inherent \n                sovereignty and right to self-government under U.S. \n                law, it is the policy of the United States to promote \n                the development of prosperous and resilient tribal \n                communities, including by:\n\n                    (a) promoting sustainable economic development, \n                particularly energy, transportation, housing, other \n                infrastructure, entrepreneurial, and workforce \n                development to drive future economic growth and \n                security;\n                    (b) supporting greater access to, and control over, \n                nutrition and healthcare, including special efforts to \n                confront historic health disparities and chronic \n                diseases;\n                    (c) supporting efforts to improve the effectiveness \n                and efficiency of tribal justice systems and protect \n                tribal communities;\n                    (d) expanding and improving lifelong educational \n                opportunities for American Indians and Alaska Natives, \n                while respecting demands for greater tribal control \n                over tribal education, consistent with Executive Order \n                13592 of December 2, 2011 (Improving American Indian \n                and Alaska Native Educational Opportunities and \n                Strengthening Tribal Colleges and Universities); and\n\n[[Page 39540]]\n\n                    (e) protecting tribal lands, environments, and \n                natural resources, and promoting respect for tribal \n                cultures.\n\n                Sec. 2.

Policy. Repeated cyber intrusions into \n                critical infrastructure demonstrate the need for \n                improved cybersecurity. The cyber threat to critical \n                infrastructure continues to grow and represents one of \n                the most serious national security challenges we must \n                confront. The national and economic security of the \n                United States depends on the reliable functioning of \n                the Nation's critical infrastructure in the face of \n                such threats. It is the policy of the United States to \n                enhance the security and resilience of the Nation's \n                critical infrastructure and to maintain a cyber \n                environment that encourages efficiency, innovation, and \n                economic prosperity while promoting safety, security, \n                business confidentiality, privacy, and civil liberties. \n                We can achieve these goals through a partnership with \n                the owners and operators of critical infrastructure to \n                improve cybersecurity information sharing and \n                collaboratively develop and implement risk-based \n                standards.\n\n                Sec. 2. Critical Infrastructure. As used in this order, \n                the term critical infrastructure means systems and \n                assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the \n                United States that the incapacity or destruction of \n                such systems and assets would have a debilitating \n                impact on security, national economic security, \n                national public health or safety, or any combination of \n                those matters.\n\n                Sec. 3. Policy Coordination. Policy coordination, \n                guidance, dispute resolution, and periodic in-progress \n                reviews for the functions and programs described and \n                assigned herein shall be provided through the \n                interagency process established in Presidential Policy \n                Directive-1 of February 13, 2009 (Organization of the \n                National Security Council System), or any successor.\n\n                Sec. 4. Cybersecurity Information Sharing. (a) It is \n                the policy of the United States Government to increase \n                the volume, timeliness, and quality of cyber threat \n                information shared with U.S. private sector entities so \n                that these entities may better protect and defend \n                themselves against cyber threats. Within 120 days of \n                the date of this order, the Attorney General, the \n                Secretary of Homeland Security (the ``Secretary''), and \n                the Director of National Intelligence shall each issue \n                instructions consistent with their authorities and with \n                the requirements of section 12(c) of this order to \n                ensure the timely production of unclassified reports of \n                cyber threats to the U.S. homeland that identify a \n                specific targeted entity. The instructions shall \n                address the need to protect intelligence and law \n                enforcement sources, methods, operations, and \n                investigations.\n\n                    (b) The Secretary and the Attorney General, in \n                coordination with the Director of National \n                Intelligence, shall establish a process that rapidly \n                disseminates the reports produced pursuant to section \n                4(a) of this order to the targeted entity. Such process \n                shall also, consistent with the need to protect \n                national security information, include the \n                dissemination of classified reports to critical \n                infrastructure entities authorized to receive them. The \n                Secretary and the Attorney General, in coordination \n                with the Director of National Intelligence, shall \n                establish a system for tracking the production, \n                dissemination, and disposition of these reports.\n                    (c) To assist the owners and operators of critical \n                infrastructure in protecting their systems from \n                unauthorized access, exploitation, or harm, the \n                Secretary, consistent with 6 U.S.C. 143 and in \n                collaboration with the Secretary of\n\n[[Page 11740]]\n\n                Defense, shall, within 120 days of the date of this \n                order, establish procedures to expand the Enhanced \n                Cybersecurity Services program to all critical \n                infrastructure sectors. This voluntary information \n                sharing program will provide classified cyber threat \n                and technical information from the Government to \n                eligible critical infrastructure companies or \n                commercial service providers that offer security \n                services to critical infrastructure.\n                    (d) The Secretary, as the Executive Agent for the \n                Classified National Security Information Program \n                created under Executive Order 13549 of August 18, 2010 \n                (Classified National Security Information Program for \n                State, Local, Tribal, and Private Sector Entities), \n                shall expedite the processing of security clearances to \n                appropriate personnel employed by critical \n                infrastructure owners and operators, prioritizing the \n                critical infrastructure identified in section 9 of this \n                order.\n                    (e) In order to maximize the utility of cyber \n                threat information sharing with the private sector, the \n                Secretary shall expand the use of programs that bring \n                private sector subject-matter experts into Federal \n                service on a temporary basis. These subject matter \n                experts should provide advice regarding the content, \n                structure, and types of information most useful to \n                critical infrastructure owners and operators in \n                reducing and mitigating cyber risks.\n\n                Sec. 5. Privacy and Civil Liberties Protections. (a) \n                Agencies shall coordinate their activities under this \n                order with their senior agency officials for privacy \n                and civil liberties and ensure that privacy and civil \n                liberties protections are incorporated into such \n                activities. Such protections shall be based upon the \n                Fair Information Practice Principles and other privacy \n                and civil liberties policies, principles, and \n                frameworks as they apply to each agency's activities.\n\n                    (b) The Chief Privacy Officer and the Officer for \n                Civil Rights and Civil Liberties of the Department of \n                Homeland Security (DHS) shall assess the privacy and \n                civil liberties risks of the functions and programs \n                undertaken by DHS as called for in this order and shall \n                recommend to the Secretary ways to minimize or mitigate \n                such risks, in a publicly available report, to be \n                released within 1 year of the date of this order. \n                Senior agency privacy and civil liberties officials for \n                other agencies engaged in activities under this order \n                shall conduct assessments of their agency activities \n                and provide those assessments to DHS for consideration \n                and inclusion in the report. The report shall be \n                reviewed on an annual basis and revised as necessary. \n                The report may contain a classified annex if necessary. \n                Assessments shall include evaluation of activities \n                against the Fair Information Practice Principles and \n                other applicable privacy and civil liberties policies, \n                principles, and frameworks. Agencies shall consider the \n                assessments and recommendations of the report in \n                implementing privacy and civil liberties protections \n                for agency activities.\n                    (c) In producing the report required under \n                subsection (b) of this section, the Chief Privacy \n                Officer and the Officer for Civil Rights and Civil \n                Liberties of DHS shall consult with the Privacy and \n                Civil Liberties Oversight Board and coordinate with the \n                Office of Management and Budget (OMB).\n                    (d) Information submitted voluntarily in accordance \n                with 6 U.S.C. 133 by private entities under this order \n                shall be protected from disclosure to the fullest \n                extent permitted by law.\n\n                Sec. 6.

Baseline Framework to Reduce Cyber Risk to \n                Critical Infrastructure. (a) The Secretary of Commerce \n                shall direct the Director of the National\n\n[[Page 11741]]\n\n                Institute of Standards and Technology (the \n                ``Director'') to lead the development of a framework to \n                reduce cyber risks to critical infrastructure (the \n                ``Cybersecurity Framework''). The Cybersecurity \n                Framework shall include a set of standards, \n                methodologies, procedures, and processes that align \n                policy, business, and technological approaches to \n                address cyber risks. The Cybersecurity Framework shall \n                incorporate voluntary consensus standards and industry \n                best practices to the fullest extent possible. The \n                Cybersecurity Framework shall be consistent with \n                voluntary international standards when such \n                international standards will advance the objectives of \n                this order, and shall meet the requirements of the \n                National Institute of Standards and Technology Act, as \n                amended (15 U.S.C. 271 et seq.), the National \n                Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (Public \n                Law 104-113), and OMB Circular A-119, as revised.\n\n                    (b) The Cybersecurity Framework shall provide a \n                prioritized, flexible, repeatable, performance-based, \n                and cost-effective approach, including information \n                security measures and controls, to help owners and \n                operators of critical infrastructure identify, assess, \n                and manage cyber risk. The Cybersecurity Framework \n                shall focus on identifying cross-sector security \n                standards and guidelines applicable to critical \n                infrastructure. The Cybersecurity Framework will also \n                identify areas for improvement that should be addressed \n                through future collaboration with particular sectors \n                and standards-developing organizations. To enable \n                technical innovation and account for organizational \n                differences, the Cybersecurity Framework will provide \n                guidance that is technology neutral and that enables \n                critical infrastructure sectors to benefit from a \n                competitive market for products and services that meet \n                the standards, methodologies, procedures, and processes \n                developed to address cyber risks. The Cybersecurity \n                Framework shall include guidance for measuring the \n                performance of an entity in implementing the \n                Cybersecurity Framework.\n                    (c) The Cybersecurity Framework shall include \n                methodologies to identify and mitigate impacts of the \n                Cybersecurity Framework and associated information \n                security measures or controls on business \n                confidentiality, and to protect individual privacy and \n                civil liberties.\n                    (d) In developing the Cybersecurity Framework, the \n                Director shall engage in an open public review and \n                comment process. The Director shall also consult with \n                the Secretary, the National Security Agency, Sector-\n                Specific Agencies and other interested agencies \n                including OMB, owners and operators of critical \n                infrastructure, and other stakeholders through the \n                consultative process established in section 6 of this \n                order. The Secretary, the Director of National \n                Intelligence, and the heads of other relevant agencies \n                shall provide threat and vulnerability information and \n                technical expertise to inform the development of the \n                Cybersecurity Framework.

Policy. Addressing the domestic HIV epidemic \n                is a priority of my Administration. In 2010, the White \n                House released the first comprehensive National HIV/\n                AIDS Strategy (Strategy), setting quantitative goals \n                for reducing new HIV infections, improving health \n                outcomes for people living with HIV, and reducing HIV-\n                related health disparities. The Strategy will continue \n                to serve as the blueprint for our national response to \n                the domestic epidemic. It has increased coordination, \n                collaboration, and accountability across executive \n                departments and agencies (agencies) with regard to \n                addressing the epidemic. It has also focused our \n                Nation's collective efforts on increasing the use of \n                evidence-based approaches to prevention and care among \n                populations and in regions where HIV is most \n                concentrated.\n\n                Since the release of the Strategy, additional \n                scientific discoveries have greatly enhanced our \n                understanding of how to prevent and treat HIV. \n                Accordingly, further Federal action is appropriate in \n                response to these new developments. For example, a \n                breakthrough research trial supported by the National \n                Institutes of Health showed that initiating HIV \n                treatment when the immune system was relatively healthy \n                reduced HIV transmission by 96 percent. In addition, \n                evidence suggests that early treatment may reduce HIV-\n                related complications. These findings highlight the \n                importance of prompt HIV diagnosis, and because of \n                recent advances in HIV testing technology, HIV can be \n                detected sooner and more rapidly than ever before.\n\n                Based on these and other data, recommendations for HIV \n                testing and treatment have changed. The U.S. Preventive \n                Services Task Force now recommends that clinicians \n                screen all individuals ages 15 to 65 years for HIV, and \n                the Department of Health and Human Services Guidelines \n                for Use of Antiretroviral Agents now recommends \n                offering treatment to all adolescents and adults \n                diagnosed with HIV.\n\n                Furthermore, ongoing implementation of the Affordable \n                Care Act provides a historic opportunity for Americans \n                to access affordable, quality health care. The Act is \n                expanding access to recommended preventive services \n                with no out-of-pocket costs, including HIV testing, \n                and, beginning in 2014, insurance companies will not be \n                able to deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions, \n                including HIV. Starting October 1, 2013, Americans can \n                select the coverage that best suits them through the \n                new Health Insurance Marketplace, and coverage will \n                begin January 1, 2014.\n\n                Despite progress in combating HIV, important work \n                remains. Since the publication of the Strategy, data \n                released by the Centers for Disease Control and \n                Prevention show that there are significant gaps along \n                the HIV care continuum--the sequential stages of care \n                from being diagnosed to receiving optimal treatment. \n                Nearly one-fifth of the estimated 1.1 million people \n                living with HIV in the United States are undiagnosed; \n                one-third are not linked to medical care; nearly two-\n                thirds are not engaged in ongoing care; and only one-\n                quarter have the virus effectively controlled, which is \n                necessary to maintain long-term health and reduce risk \n                of transmission to others.\n\n[[Page 43058]]\n\n                In light of these data, we must further clarify and \n                focus our national efforts to prevent and treat HIV \n                infection. It is the policy of my Administration that \n                agencies implementing the Strategy prioritize \n                addressing the continuum of HIV care, including by \n                accelerating efforts to increase HIV testing, services, \n                and treatment along the continuum. This acceleration \n                will enable us to meet the goals of the Strategy and \n                move closer to an AIDS-free generation.\n\n                Sec. 2. Establishment of the HIV Care Continuum \n                Initiative. There is established the HIV Care Continuum \n                Initiative (Initiative), to be overseen by the Director \n                of the Office of National AIDS Policy. The Initiative \n                will mobilize and coordinate Federal efforts in \n                response to recent advances regarding how to prevent \n                and treat HIV infection. The Initiative will support \n                further integration of HIV prevention and care efforts; \n                promote expansion of successful HIV testing and service \n                delivery models; encourage innovative approaches to \n                addressing barriers to accessing testing and treatment; \n                and ensure that Federal resources are appropriately \n                focused on implementing evidence-based interventions \n                that improve outcomes along the HIV care continuum.\n\n                Sec. 3. Establishment of the HIV Care Continuum Working \n                Group. There is established the HIV Care Continuum \n                Working Group (Working Group) to support the \n                Initiative. The Working Group shall coordinate Federal \n                efforts to improve outcomes nationally across the HIV \n                care continuum.\n\n                    (a) Membership. The Working Group shall be co-\n                chaired by the Director of the Office of National AIDS \n                Policy and the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n                or designee (Co-Chairs). In addition to the Co-Chairs, \n                the Working Group shall consist of representatives \n                from:\n\n(i) the Department of Justice;\n\n(ii) the Department of Labor;\n\n(iii) the Department of Health and Human Services;\n\n(iv) the Department of Housing and Urban Development;\n\n(v) the Department of Veterans Affairs;\n\n(vi) the Office of Management and Budget; and\n\n(vii) other agencies and offices, as designated by the Co-Chairs.\n\n                    (b) Consultation. The Working Group shall consult \n                with the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS, as \n                appropriate.\n                    (c) Functions. As part of the Initiative, the \n                Working Group shall:\n\n(i) request and review information from agencies describing efforts to \nimprove testing, care, and treatment outcomes, and determine if there is \nappropriate emphasis on addressing the HIV care continuum in relation to \nother work concerning the domestic epidemic;\n\n(ii) review research on improving outcomes along the HIV care continuum;\n\n(iii) obtain input from Federal grantees, affected communities, and other \nstakeholders to inform strategies to improve outcomes along the HIV care \ncontinuum;\n\n(iv) identify potential impediments to improving outcomes along the HIV \ncare continuum, including for populations at greatest risk for HIV \ninfection, based on the efforts undertaken pursuant to paragraphs (i), \n(ii), and (iii) of this subsection;\n\n(v) identify opportunities to address issues identified pursuant to \nparagraph (iv) of this subsection, and thereby improve outcomes along the \nHIV care continuum;\n\n(vi) recommend ways to integrate efforts to improve outcomes along the HIV \ncare continuum with other evidence-based strategies to combat HIV; and\n\n(vii) specify how to better align and coordinate Federal efforts, both \nwithin and across agencies, to improve outcomes along the HIV care \ncontinuum.\n\n                    (d) Reporting.\n\n[[Page 43059]]\n\n(i) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Working Group shall \nprovide recommendations to the President on actions that agencies can take \nto improve outcomes along the HIV care continuum.\n\n(ii) Thereafter, the Director of the Office of National AIDS Policy shall \ninclude, as part of the annual report to the President pursuant to section \n1(b) of my memorandum of July 13, 2010 (Implementation of the National HIV/\nAIDS Strategy), a report prepared by the Working Group on Government-wide \nprogress in implementing this order.

Purpose. Chemicals, and the facilities where \n                they are manufactured, stored, distributed, and used, \n                are essential to today's economy. Past and recent \n                tragedies have reminded us, however, that the handling \n                and storage of chemicals are not without risk. The \n                Federal Government has developed and implemented \n                numerous programs aimed at reducing the safety risks \n                and security risks associated with hazardous chemicals. \n                However, additional measures can be taken by executive \n                departments and agencies (agencies) with regulatory \n                authority to further improve chemical facility safety \n                and security in coordination with owners and operators.\n\n                Sec. 2. Establishment of the Chemical Facility Safety \n                and Security Working Group.

In addition, the Working \n                Group shall consist of the head of each of the \n                following agencies or their designated representatives \n                at the Assistant Secretary level or higher:\n\n                    (i) the Department of Justice;\n                    (ii) the Department of Agriculture; and\n                    (iii) the Department of Transportation.\n                    (b) In carrying out its responsibilities under this \n                order, the Working Group shall consult with \n                representatives from:\n                    (i) the Council on Environmental Quality;\n                    (ii) the National Security Staff;\n                    (iii) the Domestic Policy Council;\n                    (iv) the Office of Science and Technology Policy;\n                    (v) the Office of Management and Budget (OMB);\n                    (vi) the White House Office of Cabinet Affairs; and\n                    (vii) such other agencies and offices as the \n                President may designate.\n                    (c) The Working Group shall meet no less than \n                quarterly to discuss the status of efforts to implement \n                this order. The Working Group is encouraged to invite \n                other affected agencies, such as the Nuclear Regulatory \n                Commission, to attend these meetings as appropriate. \n                Additionally, the Working Group shall provide, within \n                270 days of the date of this order, a status report to \n                the President through the Chair of the Council on \n                Environmental Quality and the Assistant to the \n                President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism.\n\n                Sec. 3. Improving Operational Coordination with State, \n                Local, and Tribal Partners. (a) Within 135 days of the \n                date of this order, the Working Group shall develop a \n                plan to support and further enable efforts by State \n                regulators, State, local, and tribal emergency \n                responders, chemical facility owners and operators, and \n                local and tribal communities to work together to \n                improve chemical facility safety and security. In \n                developing this plan, the Working Group shall:\n\n[[Page 48030]]\n\n(i) identify ways to improve coordination among the Federal Government, \nfirst responders, and State, local, and tribal entities;\n\n(ii) take into account the capabilities, limitations, and needs of the \nfirst responder community;\n\n(iii) identify ways to ensure that State homeland security advisors, State \nEmergency Response Commissions (SERCs), Tribal Emergency Response \nCommissions (TERCs), Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs), Tribal \nEmergency Planning Committees (TEPCs), State regulators, and first \nresponders have ready access to key information in a useable format, \nincluding by thoroughly reviewing categories of chemicals for which \ninformation is provided to first responders and the manner in which it is \nmade available, so as to prevent, prepare for, and respond to chemical \nincidents;\n\n(iv) identify areas, in collaboration with State, local, and tribal \ngovernments and private sector partners, where joint collaborative programs \ncan be developed or enhanced, including by better integrating existing \nauthorities, jurisdictional responsibilities, and regulatory programs in \norder to achieve a more comprehensive engagement on chemical risk \nmanagement;\n\n(v) identify opportunities and mechanisms to improve response procedures \nand to enhance information sharing and collaborative planning between \nchemical facility owners and operators, TEPCs, LEPCs, and first responders;\n\n(vi) working with the National Response Team (NRT) and Regional Response \nTeams (RRTs), identify means for Federal technical assistance to support \ndeveloping, implementing, exercising, and revising State, local, and tribal \nemergency contingency plans, including improved training; and\n\n(vii) examine opportunities to improve public access to information about \nchemical facility risks consistent with national security needs and \nappropriate protection of confidential business information.\n\n                    (b) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the \n                Attorney General, through the head of the Bureau of \n                Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), shall \n                assess the feasibility of sharing data related to the \n                storage of explosive materials with SERCs, TEPCs, and \n                LEPCs.\n                    (c) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the \n                Secretary of Homeland Security shall assess the \n                feasibility of sharing Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism \n                Standards (CFATS) data with SERCs, TEPCs, and LEPCs on \n                a categorical basis.\n\n                Sec. 4. Enhanced Federal Coordination. In order to \n                enhance Federal coordination regarding chemical \n                facility safety and security:\n\n                    (a) Within 45 days of the date of this order, the \n                Working Group shall deploy a pilot program, involving \n                the EPA, Department of Labor, Department of Homeland \n                Security, and any other appropriate agency, to validate \n                best practices and to test innovative methods for \n                Federal interagency collaboration regarding chemical \n                facility safety and security. The pilot program shall \n                operate in at least one region and shall integrate \n                regional Federal, State, local, and tribal assets, \n                where appropriate.

Policy. Over the past generation, our \n                society has made tremendous progress in eradicating \n                barriers to women's success. A record number of women \n                are attending college and graduate school. Women make \n                up a growing share of our workforce, and more women are \n                corporate executives and business owners than ever \n                before, helping boost the U.S. economy and foster U.S. \n                competitiveness around the world. Today, women are \n                serving at the highest levels of all branches of our \n                Government.\n\n                Despite this progress, certain inequalities continue to \n                persist. On average, American women continue to earn \n                only about 78 cents for every dollar men make, and \n                women are still significantly underrepresented in the \n                science, engineering, and technology fields. Far too \n                many women lack health insurance, and many are unable \n                to take time off to care for a new baby or an ailing \n                family member. Violence against women and girls remains \n                a global epidemic. The challenge of ensuring equal \n                educational opportunities for women and girls endures. \n                As the current economic crisis has swept across our \n                Nation, women have been seriously affected.\n\n                These issues do not concern just women. When jobs do \n                not offer family leave, that affects men who wish to \n                help care for their families. When women earn less than \n                men for the same work, that affects families who have \n                to work harder to make ends meet. When our daughters do \n                not have the same educational and career opportunities \n                as our sons, that affects entire communities, our \n                economy, and our future as a Nation.\n\n                The purpose of this order is to establish a coordinated \n                Federal response to issues that particularly impact the \n                lives of women and girls and to ensure that Federal \n                programs and policies address and take into account the \n                distinctive concerns of women and girls, including \n                women of color and those with disabilities.\n\n                Sec. 2. White House Council on Women and Girls. There \n                is established within the Executive Office of the \n                President a White House Council on Women and Girls \n                (Council).\n\n(a) Membership of the Council. The Council shall consist of the following \nmembers:\n\n(1) the Senior Advisor and Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental \nAffairs and Public Liaison, who shall serve as Chair of the Council;\n\n(2) the Secretary of State;\n\n(3) the Secretary of the Treasury;\n\n(4) the Secretary of Defense;\n\n(5) the Attorney General;\n\n(6) the Secretary of the Interior;\n\n(7) the Secretary of Agriculture;\n\n(8) the Secretary of Commerce;\n\n(9) the Secretary of Labor;\n\n(10) the Secretary of Health and Human Services;\n\n(11) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development;\n\n(12) the Secretary of Transportation;\n\n(13) the Secretary of Energy;\n\n[[Page 11272]]\n\n(14) the Secretary of Education;\n\n(15) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs;\n\n(16) the Secretary of Homeland Security;\n\n(17) the Representative of the United States of America to the United \nNations;\n\n(18) the United States Trade Representative;\n\n(19) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget;\n\n(20) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency;\n\n(21) the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers;\n\n(22) the Director of the Office of Personnel Management;\n\n(23) the Administrator of the Small Business Administration;\n\n(24) the Assistant to the President and Director of the Domestic Policy \nCouncil;\n\n(25) the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Director of the \nNational Economic Council; and\n\n(26) the heads of such other executive branch departments, agencies, and \noffices as the President may, from time to time, designate.\n\nA member of the Council may designate, to perform the Council functions of \nthe member, a senior-level official who is a part of the member's \ndepartment, agency, or office, and who is a full-time officer or employee \nof the Federal Government. At the direction of the Chair, the Council may \nestablish subgroups consisting exclusively of Council members or their \ndesignees under this section, as appropriate.\n\n(b) Administration of the Council. The Department of Commerce shall provide \nfunding and administrative support for the Council to the extent permitted \nby law and within existing appropriations. The Chair shall convene regular \nmeetings of the Council, determine its agenda, and direct its work. The \nChair shall designate an Executive Director of the Council, who shall \ncoordinate the work of the Council and head any staff assigned to the \nCouncil.\n\n                Sec. 3. Mission and Functions of the Council. The \n                Council shall work across executive departments and \n                agencies to provide a coordinated Federal response to \n                issues that have a distinct impact on the lives of \n                women and girls, including assisting women-owned \n                businesses to compete internationally and working to \n                increase the participation of women in the science, \n                engineering, and technology workforce, and to ensure \n                that Federal programs and policies adequately take \n                those impacts into account. The Council shall be \n                responsible for providing recommendations to the \n                President on the effects of pending legislation and \n                executive branch policy proposals; for suggesting \n                changes to Federal programs or policies to address \n                issues of special importance to women and girls; for \n                reviewing and recommending changes to policies that \n                have a distinct impact on women in the Federal \n                workforce; and for assisting in the development of \n                legislative and policy proposals of special importance \n                to women and girls. The functions of the Council are \n                advisory only.\n\n                Sec. 4. Outreach. Consistent with the objectives set \n                out in this order, the Council, in accordance with \n                applicable law, in addition to regular meetings, shall \n                conduct outreach with representatives of nonprofit \n                organizations, State and local government agencies, \n                elected officials, and other interested persons that \n                will assist with the Council's development of a \n                detailed set of recommendations.\n\n                Sec. 5. Federal Interagency Plan. The Council shall, \n                within 150 days of the date of this order, develop and \n                submit to the President a Federal interagency plan with \n                recommendations for interagency action consistent with \n                the goals of this order. The Federal interagency plan \n                shall include an assessment by each member executive \n                department, agency, or office of the status and scope \n                of its efforts to further the progress and advancement \n                of women and girls. Such an assessment shall include a \n                report on the status of any offices or programs that \n                have been created to develop, implement, or monitor \n                targeted initiatives concerning women or girls.

Policy. The more than 16 million Asian \n                Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) across our \n                country have helped build a strong and vibrant America. \n                The AAPI communities represent many ethnicities and \n                languages that span generations, and their shared \n                achievements are an important part of the American \n                experience. They have started businesses and generated \n                jobs, including founding some of our Nation's most \n                successful and innovative enterprises. The AAPI \n                communities have made important contributions to \n                science and technology, culture and the arts, and the \n                professions, including business, law, medicine, \n                education, and politics.\n\n                While we acknowledge the many contributions of the AAPI \n                communities to our Nation, we also recognize the \n                challenges still faced by many AAPIs. Of the more than \n                a million AAPI-owned businesses, many firms are small \n                sole-proprietorships that continue to need assistance \n                to access available resources such as business \n                development counseling and small business loans. The \n                AAPI community also continues to face barriers to \n                employment and workplace advancement. Specific \n                challenges experienced by AAPI subgroups include lower \n                college-enrollment rates by Pacific Islanders than \n                other ethnic groups and high poverty rates among Hmong \n                Americans, Cambodian Americans, Malaysian Americans, \n                and other individual AAPI communities. Additionally, \n                one in five non-elderly AAPIs lacks health insurance.\n\n                The purpose of this order is to establish a President's \n                Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific \n                Islanders and a White House Initiative on Asian \n                Americans and Pacific Islanders. Each will work to \n                improve the quality of life and opportunities for Asian \n                Americans and Pacific Islanders through increased \n                access to, and participation in, Federal programs in \n                which they may be underserved. In addition, each will \n                work to advance relevant evidence-based research, data \n                collection, and analysis for AAPI populations and \n                subpopulations.\n\n                Sec. 2. President's Advisory Commission on Asian \n                Americans and Pacific Islanders. There is established \n                in the Department of Education the President's Advisory \n                Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders \n                (Commission).\n\n                (a) Mission and Function of the Commission. The \n                Commission shall provide advice to the President, \n                through the Secretaries of Education and Commerce, as \n                Co-Chairs of the Initiative described in section 3 of \n                this order, on: (i) the development, monitoring, and \n                coordination of executive branch efforts to improve the \n                quality of life of AAPIs through increased \n                participation in Federal programs in which such persons \n                may be underserved; (ii) the compilation of research \n                and data related to AAPI populations and \n                subpopulations; (iii) the development, monitoring, and \n                coordination of Federal efforts to improve the economic \n                and community development of AAPI businesses; and (iv) \n                strategies to increase public and private-sector \n                collaboration, and community involvement in improving \n                the health, education, environment, and well-being of \n                AAPIs.\n\n[[Page 53636]]\n\n                (b) Membership of the Commission.

Insofar as \n                the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 \n                U.S.C. App.) (the ``Act''), may apply to the \n                administration of the Commission, any functions of the \n                President under the Act, except that of reporting to \n                the Congress, shall be performed by the Secretary of \n                Education, in accordance with the guidelines issued by \n                the Administrator of General Services.\n\n                (d) Termination Date. The Commission shall terminate 2 \n                years from the date of this order, unless renewed by \n                the President.\n\n                Sec. 3.

Policy. The economic and financial crisis \n                has led to the loss of millions of U.S. jobs, and while \n                the economy is beginning to show signs of recovery, \n                millions of Americans remain unemployed or \n                underemployed. Creating jobs in the United States and \n                ensuring a return to sustainable economic growth is the \n                top priority for my Administration. A critical \n                component of stimulating economic growth in the United \n                States is ensuring that U.S. businesses can actively \n                participate in international markets by increasing \n                their exports of goods, services, and agricultural \n                products. Improved export performance will, in turn, \n                create good high-paying jobs.\n\n                The National Export Initiative (NEI) shall be an \n                Administration initiative to improve conditions that \n                directly affect the private sector's ability to export. \n                The NEI will help meet my Administration's goal of \n                doubling exports over the next 5 years by working to \n                remove trade barriers abroad, by helping firms--\n                especially small businesses--overcome the hurdles to \n                entering new export markets, by assisting with \n                financing, and in general by pursuing a Government-wide \n                approach to export advocacy abroad, among other steps.\n\n                Sec. 2. Export Promotion Cabinet. There is established \n                an Export Promotion Cabinet to develop and coordinate \n                the implementation of the NEI. The Export Promotion \n                Cabinet shall consist of:\n\n                    (a) the Secretary of State;\n                    (b) the Secretary of the Treasury;\n                    (c) the Secretary of Agriculture;\n                    (d) the Secretary of Commerce;\n                    (e) the Secretary of Labor;\n                    (f) the Director of the Office of Management and \n                Budget;\n                    (g) the United States Trade Representative;\n                    (h) the Assistant to the President for Economic \n                Policy;\n                    (i) the National Security Advisor;\n                    (j) the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers;\n                    (k) the President of the Export-Import Bank of the \n                United States;\n                    (l) the Administrator of the Small Business \n                Administration;\n                    (m) the President of the Overseas Private \n                Investment Corporation;\n                    (n) the Director of the United States Trade and \n                Development Agency; and\n                    (o) the heads of other executive branch \n                departments, agencies, and offices as the President \n                may, from time to time, designate.\n\n[[Page 12434]]\n\n                The Export Promotion Cabinet shall meet periodically \n                and report to the President on the progress of the NEI. \n                A member of the Export Promotion Cabinet may designate, \n                to perform the NEI-related functions of that member, a \n                senior official from the member's department or agency \n                who is a full-time officer or employee.

The Export Promotion Cabinet shall coordinate \n                with the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC), \n                established by Executive Order 12870 of September 30, \n                1993.\n\n                Sec. 3. National Export Initiative. The NEI shall \n                address the following:\n\n                    (a) Exports by Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises \n                (SMEs). Members of the Export Promotion Cabinet shall \n                develop programs, in consultation with the TPCC, \n                designed to enhance export assistance to SMEs, \n                including programs that improve information and other \n                technical assistance to first-time exporters and assist \n                current exporters in identifying new export \n                opportunities in international markets.\n                    (b) Federal Export Assistance.

The Secretary of Commerce, in \n                consultation with the TPCC and, to the extent possible, \n                with State and local government officials and the \n                private sector, shall ensure that U.S. Government-led \n                trade missions effectively promote exports by U.S. \n                companies.\n                    (d) Commercial Advocacy. Members of the Export \n                Promotion Cabinet, in consultation with other \n                departments and agencies and in coordination with the \n                Advocacy Center at the Department of Commerce, shall \n                take steps to ensure that the Federal Government's \n                commercial advocacy effectively promotes exports by \n                U.S. companies.\n                    (e) Increasing Export Credit.

The United States \n                Trade Representative, in consultation with other \n                members of the Export Promotion Cabinet, shall take \n                steps to improve market access overseas for our \n                manufacturers, farmers, and service providers by \n                actively opening new markets, reducing significant \n                trade barriers, and robustly enforcing our trade \n                agreements.\n                    (h) Export Promotion of Services. Members of the \n                Export Promotion Cabinet shall develop a framework for \n                promoting services trade, including the necessary \n                policy and export promotion tools.\n\n                Sec. 4.

Policy. It is the policy of the United \n                States that:\n\n                    (a) A robust and productive scientific enterprise \n                that utilizes biological select agents and toxins \n                (BSAT) is essential to national security;\n                    (b) BSAT shall be secured in a manner appropriate \n                to their risk of misuse, theft, loss, and accidental \n                release; and\n                    (c) Security measures shall be taken in a \n                coordinated manner that balances their efficacy with \n                the need to minimize the adverse impact on the \n                legitimate use of BSAT.\n\n                Sec. 2. Definitions. (a) ``Select Agent Program'' (SAP) \n                means the regulatory oversight and administrative \n                activities conducted by the Secretaries of Health and \n                Human Services and Agriculture and the Attorney General \n                to implement the Public Health Security and \n                Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 and \n                the Agricultural Bioterrorism Protection Act of 2002.\n\n                    (b) ``Select Agent Regulations'' (SAR) means the \n                Federal regulations found in Part 73 of Title 42 of the \n                Code of Federal Regulations, Part 331 of Title 7 of the \n                Code of Federal Regulations, and Part 121 of Title 9 of \n                the Code of Federal Regulations.\n                    (c) ``Biological Select Agents and Toxins'' means \n                biological agents and toxins with the potential to pose \n                a severe threat to public health and safety, animal and \n                plant health, or animal and plant products and whose \n                possession, use, and transfer are regulated by the \n                Department of Health and Human Services and the \n                Department of Agriculture under the SAR.\n\n                Sec. 3. Findings. (a) The use of BSAT presents the risk \n                that BSAT might be lost, stolen, or diverted for \n                malicious purpose. The SAP exists to provide effective \n                regulatory oversight of the possession, use, and \n                transfer of BSAT that reduces the risk of their misuse \n                or mishandling. The absence of clearly defined, risk-\n                based security measures in the SAR/SAP has raised \n                concern about the need for optimized security and for \n                risk management.\n\n                    (b) In addition, variations in, and limited \n                coordination of, individual executive departments' and \n                agencies' oversight, security practices, and \n                inspections have raised concerns that the cost and \n                complexity of compliance for those who are registered \n                to work with BSAT could discourage research or other \n                legitimate activities.\n                    (c) Understanding that research and laboratory work \n                on BSAT is essential to both public health and national \n                security, it is in the interest of the United States to \n                address these issues.\n\n                Sec. 4. Risk-based Tiering of the Select Agent List. To \n                help ensure that BSAT are secured according to level of \n                risk, the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and \n                Agriculture shall, through their ongoing review of the \n                biological Select Agents and Toxins List (``Select \n                Agent List'') contained in regulations, and no later \n                than 18 months from the date of this order:\n\n                    (a) designate a subset of the Select Agent List \n                (Tier 1) that presents the greatest risk of deliberate \n                misuse with most significant potential for mass \n                casualties or devastating effects to the economy, \n                critical infrastructure, or public confidence;\n\n[[Page 39440]]\n\n                    (b) explore options for graded protection of Tier 1 \n                agents and toxins as described in subsection (a) of \n                this section to permit tailored risk management \n                practices based upon relevant contextual factors; and\n                    (c) consider reducing the overall number of agents \n                and toxins on the Select Agent List.\n\n                Sec. 5. Revision of Regulations, Rules, and Guidance to \n                Accommodate a Tiered Select Agent List. Consistent with \n                section 4 of this order, I request that:\n\n                    (a) The Secretaries of Health and Human Services \n                and Agriculture, no later than 15 months from the date \n                of this order, propose amendments to their respective \n                parts of the SAR that would establish security \n                standards specific to Tier 1 agents and toxins.\n                    (b) The Secretaries of Health and Human Services \n                and Agriculture each, no later than 27 months from the \n                date of this order, promulgate final rules and guidance \n                that clearly articulate security actions for \n                registrants who possess, use, or transfer Tier 1 agents \n                and toxins.\n\n                Sec. 6. Coordination of Federal Oversight for BSAT \n                Security. To ensure that the policies and practices \n                used to secure BSAT are harmonized and that the related \n                oversight activities of the Federal Government are \n                coordinated, the heads of executive departments and \n                agencies identified in section 7(a)(ii) of this order \n                shall:\n\n                    (a) no later than 6 months from the date of this \n                order, develop and implement a plan for the \n                coordination of BSAT security oversight that:\n\n(i) articulates a mechanism for coordinated and reciprocal inspection of \nand harmonized administrative practices for facilities registered with the \nSAP;\n\n(ii) ensures consistent and timely identification and resolution of BSAT \nsecurity and compliance issues;\n\n(iii) facilitates information sharing among departments and agencies \nregarding ongoing oversight and inspection activities; and\n\n(iv) provides for comprehensive and effective Federal oversight of BSAT \nsecurity; and\n\n                    (b) no later than 6 months from the issuance of \n                final rules and guidance as described in section 5 of \n                this order, and annually thereafter, review for \n                inconsistent requirements and revise or rescind, as \n                appropriate, any regulations, directives, guidance, or \n                policies regarding BSAT security within their \n                department or agency that exceed those in the updated \n                SAR and guidance as described in section 5 of this \n                order.\n\n                Sec. 7. Implementation. (a) Establishment, Operation, \n                and Functions of the Federal Experts Security Advisory \n                Panel.\n\n(i) There is hereby established, within the Department of Health and Human \nServices for administrative purposes only, the Federal Experts Security \nAdvisory Panel (Panel), which shall make technical and substantive \nrecommendations on BSAT security concerning the SAP.\n\n(ii) The Panel shall consist of representatives from the following, who may \nconsult with additional experts from their department or agency as \nrequired:\n\n  1. the Department of State;\n\n  2. the Department of Defense;\n\n  3. the Department of Justice;\n\n  4. the Department of Agriculture (Co-Chair);\n\n  5. the Department of Commerce;\n\n  6. the Department of Health and Human Services (Co-Chair);\n\n  7. the Department of Transportation;\n\n  8. the Department of Labor;\n\n[[Page 39441]]\n\n  9. the Department of Energy;\n\n  10. the Department of Veterans Affairs;\n\n  11. the Department of Homeland Security;\n\n  12. the Environmental Protection Agency;\n\n  13. the Office of the Director of National Intelligence;\n\n  14. the Office of Science and Technology Policy;\n\n  15. the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and\n\n  16. any other department or agency designated by the Co-Chairs.\n\n(iii) To assist the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and \nAgriculture and the Attorney General in implementing the policies set forth \nin sections 1, 4, 5, and 6 of this order, the Panel shall, no later than 4 \nmonths from the date of this order, provide consensus recommendations \nconcerning the SAP on:\n\n  1. the designation of Tier 1 agents and toxins;\n\n  2. reduction in the number of agents on the Select Agent List;\n\n  3. the establishment of appropriate practices to ensure reliability of \npersonnel with access to Tier 1 agents and toxins at registered facilities;\n\n  4. the establishment of appropriate practices for physical security and \ncyber security for facilities that possess Tier 1 agents.

Policy. Business investment in the United \n                States by both domestic and foreign firms, whether in \n                the form of new equipment or facilities or the \n                expansion of existing facilities, is a major engine of \n                economic growth and job creation. In an era of global \n                capital mobility, the United States faces increasing \n                competition for retaining and attracting industries of \n                the future and the jobs they create. My Administration \n                is committed to enhancing the efforts of the United \n                States to win the growing global competition for \n                business investment by leveraging our advantages as the \n                premier business location in the world.\n\n                As a place to do business, the United States offers a \n                hardworking, diverse, and educated workforce, strong \n                protection of intellectual property rights, a \n                predictable and transparent legal system, relatively \n                low taxes, highly developed infrastructure, and access \n                to the world's most lucrative consumer market. We \n                welcome both domestic and foreign businesses to invest \n                across the broad spectrum of the U.S. market.\n\n                The Federal Government lacks the centralized investment \n                promotion infrastructure and resources to attract \n                business investment that is often found in other \n                industrialized countries. Currently, States and cities \n                are competing against foreign governments to attract \n                business investment. Our Nation needs to retain \n                business investment and pursue and win new investment \n                in the United States by better marketing our strengths, \n                providing clear, complete, and consistent information, \n                and removing unnecessary obstacles to investment.\n\n                Sec. 2. SelectUSA Initiative. (a) Establishment. There \n                is established the SelectUSA Initiative (Initiative), a \n                Government-wide initiative to attract and retain \n                investment in the American economy. The Initiative is \n                to be housed in the Department of Commerce. The mission \n                of this Initiative shall be to facilitate business \n                investment in the United States in order to create \n                jobs, spur economic growth, and promote American \n                competitiveness. The Initiative will provide enhanced \n                coordination of Federal activities in order to increase \n                the impact of Federal resources that support both \n                domestic and foreign investment in the United States. \n                In providing assistance, the Initiative shall work to \n                maximize impact on business investment, job creation, \n                and economic growth. The Initiative shall work on \n                behalf of the entire Nation and shall exercise strict \n                neutrality with regard to specific locations within the \n                United States.\n\n                    (b) Functions.\n\n(i) The Initiative shall coordinate outreach and engagement by the Federal \nGovernment to promote the United States as the premier location to operate \na business.\n\n(ii) The Initiative shall serve as an ombudsman that facilitates the \nresolution of issues involving Federal programs or activities related to \npending investments.\n\n[[Page 35716]]\n\n(iii) The Initiative shall provide information to domestic and foreign \nfirms on: the investment climate in the United States; Federal programs and \nincentives available to investors; and State and local economic development \norganizations.\n\n(iv) The Initiative shall report quarterly to the President through the \nNational Economic Council, the Domestic Policy Council, and the National \nSecurity Staff, describing its outreach activities, requests for \ninformation received, and efforts to resolve issues.\n\n                    (c) Administration. The Department of Commerce \n                shall provide funding and administrative support for \n                the Initiative through resources and staff assigned to \n                work on the Initiative, to the extent permitted by law \n                and within existing appropriations. The Secretary of \n                Commerce shall designate a senior staff member as the \n                Executive Director to lead the Initiative. The \n                Executive Director shall coordinate activities both \n                within the Department of Commerce and with other \n                executive departments and agencies that have activities \n                relating to business investment decisions.\n                    (d) Federal Interagency Investment Working Group.\n\n(i) There is established the Federal Interagency Investment Working Group \n(Working Group), which will be convened and chaired by the Initiative's \nExecutive Director, in coordination with the Director of the National \nEconomic Council.\n\n(ii) The Working Group shall consist of senior officials from the \nDepartments of State, the Treasury, Defense, Justice, the Interior, \nAgriculture, Commerce, Labor, Veterans Affairs, Health and Human Services, \nHousing and Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, Education, and \nHomeland Security, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Small Business \nAdministration, the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the Office of \nthe United States Trade Representative, the Domestic Policy Council, the \nNational Economic Council, the National Security Staff, the Office of \nManagement and Budget, and the Council of Economic Advisers, as well as \nsuch additional executive departments, agencies, and offices as the \nSecretary of Commerce may designate.

Where \n                appropriate, specified agency heads shall, to the \n                extent permitted by law, amend all such existing \n                policies of their respective agencies to ensure that \n                they are consistent with the fundamental principles set \n                forth in section 2 of this order.\n                    (b) Uniform Agency Implementation. Within 120 days \n                of the date of this order, the Working Group shall \n                submit a report to the President on amendments, \n                changes, or additions that are necessary to ensure that \n                regulations and guidance documents associated with the \n                distribution of Federal financial assistance for social \n                service programs are consistent with the fundamental \n                principles set forth in section 2 of this order. The \n                Working Group's report should include, but not be \n                limited to, a model set of regulations and guidance \n                documents for agencies to adopt in the following areas:\n                    (i) prohibited uses of direct Federal financial \n                assistance and separation requirements; (ii) \n                protections for religious identity; (iii) the \n                distinction between ``direct'' and ``indirect'' Federal \n                financial assistance; (iv) protections for \n                beneficiaries of social service programs; (v) \n                transparency requirements, consistent with and in \n                furtherance of existing open government initiatives; \n                (vi) obligations of nongovernmental and governmental \n                intermediaries; (vii) instructions for peer reviewers \n                and those who recruit peer reviewers; and (viii) \n                training on these matters for government employees and \n                for Federal, State, and local governmental and \n                nongovernmental organizations that receive Federal \n                financial assistance under social service programs. In \n                developing this report and in reviewing agency \n                regulations and guidance for consistency with section 2 \n                of this order, the Working Group shall consult the \n                March 2010 report and recommendations prepared by the \n                President's Advisory Council on Faith-Based and \n                Neighborhood Partnerships on the topic of reforming the \n                Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships.\n\n[[Page 71322]]\n\n                    (c) Guidance.

Policy. The public deserves competent, \n                efficient, and responsive service from the Federal \n                Government. Executive departments and agencies \n                (agencies) must continuously evaluate their performance \n                in meeting this standard and work to improve it. To \n                this end, Executive Order 12862 (Setting Customer \n                Service Standards), issued on September 11, 1993, \n                requires agencies that provide significant services \n                directly to the public to identify and survey their \n                customers, establish service standards and track \n                performance against those standards, and benchmark \n                customer service performance against the best in \n                business. This effort to ``put people first'' was an \n                important step. It was reinforced by a Presidential \n                Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and \n                Agencies issued on March 22, 1995 (Improving Customer \n                Service), and a further Presidential Memorandum issued \n                on March 3, 1998 (Conducting ``Conversations with \n                America'' to Further Improve Customer Service).\n\n                However, with advances in technology and service \n                delivery systems in other sectors, the public's \n                expectations of the Government have continued to rise. \n                The Government must keep pace with and even exceed \n                those expectations. Government must also address the \n                need to improve its services, not only to individuals, \n                but also to private and Governmental entities to which \n                the agency directly provides significant services. \n                Government managers must learn from what is working in \n                the private sector and apply these best practices to \n                deliver services better, faster, and at lower cost. \n                Such best practices include increasingly popular lower-\n                cost, self-service options accessed by the Internet or \n                mobile phone and improved processes that deliver \n                services faster and more responsively, reducing the \n                overall need for customer inquiries and complaints. The \n                Federal Government has a responsibility to streamline \n                and make more efficient its service delivery to better \n                serve the public.\n\n                Sec. 2. Agency Customer Service Plans and Activities. \n                Within 180 days of the date of this order, each agency \n                shall develop, in consultation with the Office of \n                Management and Budget (OMB), a Customer Service Plan \n                (plan) to address how the agency will provide services \n                in a manner that seeks to streamline service delivery \n                and improve the experience of its customers. As used in \n                this order, the term ``customer'' refers to any \n                individual or to any entity, including a business, \n                tribal, State or local government, or other agency, to \n                which the agency directly provides significant \n                services. The plan shall set forth the agency's \n                approach, intended benefits, and an implementation \n                timeline for the following actions:\n\n                    (a) establishing one major initiative (signature \n                initiative) that will use technology to improve the \n                customer experience;\n                    (b) establishing mechanisms to solicit customer \n                feedback on Government services and using such feedback \n                regularly to make service improvements;\n                    (c) setting clear customer service standards and \n                expectations, including, where appropriate, performance \n                goals for customer service required by the\n\n[[Page 24340]]\n\n                GPRA (Government Performance and Results) Modernization \n                Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-352);\n                    (d) improving the customer experience by adopting \n                proven customer service best practices and coordinating \n                across service channels (such as online, phone, in-\n                person, and mail services);\n                    (e) streamlining agency processes to reduce costs \n                and accelerate delivery, while reducing the need for \n                customer calls and inquiries; and\n                    (f) identifying ways to use innovative technologies \n                to accomplish the customer service activities above, \n                thereby lowering costs, decreasing service delivery \n                times, and improving the customer experience.\n\n                Sec. 3. Publication of Agency Customer Service Plans. \n                Each agency shall publish its plan on its Open \n                Government web page.\n\n                Sec. 4. Assistance in Implementation. In consultation \n                with the heads of executive departments and agencies, \n                the Chief Performance Officer, who also serves as the \n                Deputy Director for Management of the OMB, shall \n                develop guidance for implementing the activities \n                outlined in this order. Such guidance shall include, \n                among other things, the nature and scope of services to \n                which the order's requirements will apply. The Office \n                of Management and Budget, the General Services \n                Administration, and the Office of Science and \n                Technology Policy shall assist and support agencies in \n                developing customer service standards and plans, online \n                posting of customer service metrics and best practices, \n                expediting review for customer feedback mechanisms \n                under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et \n                seq.), improving the design and management of agency \n                websites providing services or information to the \n                public in compliance with section 508 of the \n                Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794d), and using \n                innovative technologies to improve customer service at \n                lower costs.\n\n                Sec. 5. Independent Agencies. Independent agencies are \n                requested to adhere to this order.\n\n                Sec. 6. Privileged Information. Nothing in this order \n                shall compel or authorize the disclosure of privileged \n                information, law enforcement information, information \n                affecting national security, or information the \n                disclosure of which is prohibited by law.\n\n                Sec. 7. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order \n                shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i) authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the \nhead thereof; or\n\n(ii) functions of the Director of the OMB relating to budgetary, \nadministrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n                    (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with \n                applicable law and subject to the availability of \n                appropriations.\n\n[[Page 24341]]\n\n                    (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, \n                create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, \n                enforceable at law or in equity by any party against \n                the United States, its departments, agencies, or \n                entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any \n                other person.\n                &lt;GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT&gt;\n                \n                    (Presidential Sig.)\n\n                THE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n                    April 27, 2011.\n\n[FR Doc. 2011-10732\nFiled 4-29-11; 8:45 am]\nBilling code 3195-W1-P\n\n\n</pre>]","url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2011/05/02/2011-10732/streamlining-service-delivery-and-improving-customer-service","president":"obama","id":"13571"},"reftime":1418257675979}

Policy. Our Nation's security requires \n                classified information to be shared immediately with \n                authorized users around the world but also requires \n                sophisticated and vigilant means to ensure it is shared \n                securely.

These \n                structural reforms will ensure coordinated interagency \n                development and reliable implementation of policies and \n                minimum standards regarding information security, \n                personnel security, and systems security; address both \n                internal and external security threats and \n                vulnerabilities; and provide policies and minimum \n                standards for sharing classified information both \n                within and outside the Federal Government. These \n                policies and minimum standards will address all \n                agencies that operate or access classified computer \n                networks, all users of classified computer networks \n                (including contractors and others who operate or access \n                classified computer networks controlled by the Federal \n                Government), and all classified information on those \n                networks.\n\n                Sec. 2. General Responsibilities of Agencies.\n\n                Sec. 2.1.

Policy. The United States has a unique \n                political and legal relationship with the federally \n                recognized American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) \n                tribes across the country, as set forth in the \n                Constitution of the United States, treaties, Executive \n                Orders, and court decisions. For centuries, the Federal \n                Government's relationship with these tribes has been \n                guided by a trust responsibility--a long-standing \n                commitment on the part of our Government to protect the \n                unique rights and ensure the well-being of our Nation's \n                tribes, while respecting their tribal sovereignty. In \n                recognition of that special commitment--and in \n                fulfillment of the solemn obligations it entails--\n                Federal agencies must help improve educational \n                opportunities provided to all AI/AN students, including \n                students attending public schools in cities and in \n                rural areas, students attending schools operated and \n                funded by the Department of the Interior's Bureau of \n                Indian Education (BIE), and students attending \n                postsecondary institutions, including Tribal Colleges \n                and Universities (TCUs). This is an urgent need. Recent \n                studies show that AI/AN students are dropping out of \n                school at an alarming rate, that our Nation has made \n                little or no progress in closing the achievement gap \n                between AI/AN students and their non-AI/AN student \n                counterparts, and that many Native languages are on the \n                verge of extinction.\n\n                It is the policy of my Administration to support \n                activities that will strengthen the Nation by expanding \n                educational opportunities and improving educational \n                outcomes for all AI/AN students in order to fulfill our \n                commitment to furthering tribal self-determination and \n                to help ensure that AI/AN students have an opportunity \n                to learn their Native languages and histories and \n                receive complete and competitive educations that \n                prepare them for college, careers, and productive and \n                satisfying lives.\n\n                My Administration is also committed to improving \n                educational opportunities for students attending TCUs. \n                TCUs maintain, preserve, and restore Native languages \n                and cultural traditions; offer a high-quality college \n                education; provide career and technical education, job \n                training, and other career-building programs; and often \n                serve as anchors in some of the country's poorest and \n                most remote areas.\n\n                Sec. 2. Definitions. (a) ``Agency'' means any executive \n                department or agency designated by the Secretary of \n                Education and the Secretary of the Interior to \n                participate in this order.\n\n                    (b) ``Indian tribe'' means an Indian or Alaska \n                Native tribe, band, nation, pueblo, village, or \n                community that the Secretary of the Interior \n                acknowledges to exist as an Indian tribe pursuant to \n                the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994, \n                25 U.S.C. 479a.\n                    (c) ``American Indian and Alaska Native'' means a \n                member of an Indian tribe, as membership is defined by \n                the tribe.\n                    (d) ``Public school'' means a Head Start center or \n                a pre-kindergarten, elementary, or secondary school \n                that is predominantly funded by public means through \n                the Federal Government, a State, a local educational \n                agency,\n\n[[Page 76604]]\n\n                or an Indian tribal government, including a school \n                operated directly by or through contract or grant with \n                the BIE, an Indian tribe, or a State, county, or local \n                government.\n                    (e) ``Tribal Colleges and Universities'' are those \n                institutions that are chartered by their respective \n                Indian tribes through the sovereign authority of the \n                tribes or by the Federal Government, and defined in \n                section 316 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 \n                U.S.C. 1059c).\n\n                Sec. 3. White House Initiative on American Indian and \n                Alaska Native Education.\n\n                    (a) Establishment. There is hereby established the \n                White House Initiative on American Indian and Alaska \n                Native Education (Initiative).

Except to the extent provided in section \n                203(b)(1), (3), and (4) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(1), \n                (3), and (4)), the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export \n                Enhancement Act of 2000 (title IX, Public Law 106-387), \n                or regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that \n                may be issued pursuant to this order, and \n                notwithstanding any contract entered into or any \n                license or permit granted prior to the effective date \n                of this order, all property and interests in property \n                of the following persons that are in the United States, \n                that hereafter come within the United States, or that \n                are or hereafter come within the possession or control \n                of United States persons, including their overseas \n                branches, are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, \n                exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:\n\n                (a) the persons listed in the Annex attached and made a \n                part of this order; and\n\n                (b) any person determined by the Secretary of the \n                Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of \n                State:\n\n(i) to be a senior official of the Government of Burma, the State Peace and \nDevelopment Council of Burma, the Union Solidarity and Development \nAssociation of Burma, or any successor entity to any of the foregoing;\n\n(ii) to be responsible for, or to have participated in, human rights abuses \nrelated to political repression in Burma;\n\n(iii) to be engaged, or to have engaged, in activities facilitating public \ncorruption by senior officials of the Government of Burma;\n\n[[Page 60224]]\n\n(iv) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, \nmaterial, logistical, or technical support for, or goods or services in \nsupport of, the Government of Burma, the State Peace and Development \nCouncil of Burma, the Union Solidarity and Development Association of \nBurma, any successor entity to any of the foregoing, any senior official of \nany of the foregoing, or any person whose property and interests in \nproperty are blocked pursuant to Executive Order 13310 or section 1(b)(i)-\n(v) of this order;\n\n(v) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for \nor on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and \ninterests in property are blocked pursuant to Executive Order 13310 or \nsection 1(b)(i)-(v) of this order; or\n\n(vi) to be a spouse or dependent child of any person whose property and \ninterests in property are blocked pursuant to this order or Executive Order \n13310.\n\n                Sec. 2. (a) Any transaction by a United States person \n                or within the United States that evades or avoids, has \n                the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to \n                violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order \n                is prohibited.\n\n                (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the \n                prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.\n\n                Sec. 3. For purposes of this order:\n\n                (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;\n\n                (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, \n                association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, \n                subgroup, or other organization;\n\n                (c) the term ``United States person'' means any United \n                States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity \n                organized under the laws of the United States or any \n                jurisdiction within the United States (including \n                foreign branches), or any person in the United States; \n                and\n\n                (d) the term ``Government of Burma'' means the \n                Government of Burma (sometimes referred to as Myanmar), \n                its agencies, instrumentalities and controlled \n                entities, and the Central Bank of Burma.\n\n                Sec. 4. I hereby determine that the making of donations \n                of the type specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 \n                U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of, \n                persons whose property and interests in property are \n                blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would \n                seriously impair my ability to deal with the national \n                emergency declared in Executive Order 13047, and relied \n                upon for additional steps taken in Executive Order \n                13310, and expanded in this order, and hereby prohibit \n                such donations as provided by section 1 of this order.\n\n                Sec. 5. For those persons whose property and interests \n                in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this \n                order who might have a constitutional presence in the \n                United States, I find that because of the ability to \n                transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior \n                notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant \n                to this order would render these measures ineffectual. \n                I therefore determine that for these measures to be \n                effective in addressing the national emergency declared \n                in Executive Order 13047, and relied upon for \n                additional steps taken in Executive Order 13310, and \n                expanded in this order, there need be no prior notice \n                of a listing or determination made pursuant to this \n                order.\n\n[[Page 60225]]\n\n                Sec. 6. The Secretary of the Treasury, after \n                consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby \n                authorized to take such actions, including the \n                promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ \n                all powers granted to the President by IEEPA and \n                section 4 of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of \n                2003 as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of \n                this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may \n                redelegate any of these functions to other officers and \n                agencies of the United States Government consistent \n                with applicable law. All agencies of the United States \n                Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate \n                measures within their authority to carry out the \n                provisions of this order.\n\n                Sec. 7. The Secretary of the Treasury, after \n                consultation with the Secretary of State, is authorized \n                to determine, subsequent to the effective date of this \n                order, that circumstances no longer warrant inclusion \n                of a person in the Annex to this order and that the \n                property and interests in property of that person are \n                therefore no longer blocked pursuant to section 1 of \n                this order.\n\n                Sec. 8. Nothing in this order is intended to affect the \n                continued effectiveness of any rules, regulations, \n                orders, licenses, or other forms of administrative \n                action issued, taken, or continued in effect heretofore \n                or hereafter under 31 C.F.R. chapter V, except as \n                expressly terminated, modified, or suspended by or \n                pursuant to this order.\n\n                Sec. 9. This order is not intended to, and does not, \n                create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, \n                enforceable at law or in equity by any party against \n                the United States, its departments, agencies, \n                instrumentalities, or entities, its officers or \n                employees, or any other person.\n\n                Sec. 10.

Policy. The travel and tourism industry is \n                one of our Nation's leading service sectors and sources \n                of exports. However, the U.S. market share of spending \n                by international travelers fell from 17 percent to 11 \n                percent of the global market from 2000 to 2010, more \n                than a 30 percent decrease in our share of the global \n                market. This decrease was due primarily to increased \n                international competition, changing patterns in global \n                development, and, to some degree, more stringent \n                security requirements imposed after 2001. Given the \n                importance of the travel and tourism industry to the \n                U.S. economy and job creation, a coordinated policy, \n                consistent with protecting our national security, is \n                needed to support a prosperous and secure travel and \n                tourism industry in the United States.\n\n                Steady progress has been made since 2010, when my \n                Administration launched the National Export Initiative \n                and the Travel Promotion Act was signed into law. While \n                our processes for moving people and goods across our \n                borders are now both more secure and more efficient, \n                new initiatives are needed to enable us to better \n                capitalize on the economic opportunities presented by a \n                dynamic 21st century travel and tourism industry.\n\n                Sec. 2. Visa and Foreign Visitor Processing. (a) The \n                Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and \n                Counterterrorism shall, consistent with Presidential \n                Policy Directive 1 or any successor documents and in \n                coordination with the Assistant to the President and \n                Cabinet Secretary, maintain an interagency process for \n                coordinating the implementation of regulatory \n                improvements and the evaluation of legislative \n                proposals to enhance and expedite travel to and arrival \n                in the United States by foreign nationals, consistent \n                with national security requirements.\n\n                    (b) The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security, \n                in consultation with the Assistant to the President for \n                Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, the Director of \n                the Office of Management and Budget, and the heads of \n                such agencies as appropriate, shall develop an \n                implementation plan, within 60 days of the date of this \n                order, describing actions to be undertaken, including \n                those that build upon efforts underway, to achieve the \n                following:\n\n(i) increase nonimmigrant visa processing capacity in China and Brazil by \n40 percent over the coming year;\n\n(ii) ensure that 80 percent of nonimmigrant visa applicants are interviewed \nwithin 3 weeks of receipt of application, recognizing that resource and \nsecurity considerations and the need to ensure provision of consular \nservices to U.S. citizens may dictate specific exceptions;\n\n(iii) increase efforts to expand the Visa Waiver Program and travel by \nnationals of Visa Waiver Program participants; and\n\n(iv) expand reciprocal recognition programs for expedited travel, such as \nthe Global Entry program.\n\n[[Page 3374]]\n\n                    This plan should also identify other appropriate \n                measures that will enhance and expedite travel to and \n                arrival in the United States by foreign nationals, \n                consistent with national security requirements, as well \n                as any potential challenges in achieving the stated \n                goals of this subsection.\n                    (c) Within 180 days of the date of this order, and \n                periodically thereafter, the Secretaries of State and \n                Homeland Security shall jointly submit through the \n                Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and \n                Counterterrorism a report to the President describing \n                the progress on achieving the goals set forth in this \n                section (as well as areas of concern or barriers to \n                achieving those goals) to ensure the country remains \n                secure while increasing travel and tourism to the \n                United States.\n                    (d) The Secretary of Commerce shall establish and \n                maintain a publicly available website that provides \n                updated metrics from across the Federal Government to \n                assist industry and travelers in understanding the \n                current status of the industry and its relevance to the \n                economy, statistics on visa processes in key travel and \n                tourism markets, and entry times into the United \n                States.\n\n                Sec. 3. Task Force on Travel and Competitiveness. (a) A \n                Task Force on Travel and Competitiveness (Task Force) \n                is hereby established to develop the National Travel \n                and Tourism Strategy described in this section. The \n                Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior shall serve as \n                Co-Chairs of the Task Force. The Task Force shall also \n                include the heads of the following executive \n                departments and agencies (agencies), or senior level \n                officials designated by them:\n\n(i) Department of State;\n\n(ii) Department of the Treasury;\n\n(iii) Department of Agriculture;\n\n(iv) Department of Labor;\n\n(v) Department of Transportation;\n\n(vi) Department of Homeland Security;\n\n(vii) Army Corps of Engineers;\n\n(viii) Office of the United States Trade Representative;\n\n(ix) Export-Import Bank; and\n\n(x) Other agencies invited to participate by the Task Force Co-Chairs.\n\n                    (b) The Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior, \n                in consultation with the Director of the Office of \n                Management and Budget, the Assistant to the President \n                for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, the \n                Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the \n                Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, shall \n                coordinate the overall work of the Task Force and \n                assist its members in performing the responsibilities \n                described herein.\n                    (c) The Task Force shall develop a National Travel \n                and Tourism Strategy with recommendations for new \n                policies and initiatives to promote domestic and \n                international travel opportunities throughout the \n                United States with the goal of increasing the United \n                States market share of worldwide travel, including \n                obtaining a greater share of long-haul travel from \n                Brazil, China, and India. Such recommendations shall \n                include, among other things, strategies to promote \n                visits to the United States public lands, waters, \n                shores, monuments, and other iconic American \n                destinations, thereby expanding job creation in the \n                United States.

For those persons whose property and interests \n                in property are blocked pursuant to this order who \n                might have a constitutional presence in the United \n                States, I find that because of the ability to transfer \n                funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to \n                such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to \n                section 1(a)(iv) of this order would render those \n                measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for \n                these measures to be effective in addressing the \n                national emergency declared in Executive Order 12957, \n                there need be no prior notice of an action taken \n                pursuant to section 1(a)(iv) of this order.\n\n                Sec. 5. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to \n                take such actions, including the promulgation of rules \n                and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to \n                the President by IEEPA and sections 6(a)(6), 6(a)(7), \n                6(a)(8), and 6(a)(9) of ISA, and to\n\n[[Page 30507]]\n\n                employ all powers granted to the United States \n                Government by section 6(a)(3) of ISA as may be \n                necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The \n                Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these \n                functions to other officers and agencies of the United \n                States Government consistent with applicable law. All \n                agencies of the United States Government are hereby \n                directed to take all appropriate measures within their \n                authority to carry out the provisions of this order.\n\n                Sec. 6.

Policy. To help protect national security \n                and further American economic, humanitarian, and \n                strategic interests in the world, it is the policy of \n                the Federal Government to promote and elevate \n                development as a core pillar of American power and \n                chart a course for development, diplomacy, and defense \n                to reinforce and complement one another. As stated in \n                the 2010 National Security Strategy and the \n                Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development, \n                the successful pursuit of development is essential to \n                advancing our national security objectives: security, \n                prosperity, respect for universal values, and a just \n                and sustainable international order. The effectiveness \n                of this development policy will depend in large measure \n                on how we engage with partners, beneficiaries of our \n                development assistance, and stakeholders.

Robust monitoring and enforcement of \n                U.S. rights under international trade agreements, and \n                enforcement of domestic trade laws, are crucial to \n                expanding exports and ensuring U.S. workers, \n                businesses, ranchers, and farmers are able to compete \n                on a level playing field with foreign trade partners. \n                To strengthen our capacity to monitor and enforce U.S. \n                trade rights and domestic trade laws, and thereby \n                enhance market access for U.S. exporters, executive \n                departments and agencies (agencies) must coordinate and \n                augment their efforts to identify and reduce or \n                eliminate foreign trade barriers and unfair foreign \n                trade practices to ensure that U.S. workers, \n                businesses, ranchers, and farmers receive the maximum \n                benefit from our international trade agreements and \n                under domestic trade laws.\n\n                Sec. 2.

These efforts take many forms, but all \n                contain a communications element and some use of \n                communications strategies directed to audiences outside \n                the United States to counter the ideology and \n                activities of such organizations. These communications \n                strategies focus not only on the violent actions and \n                human costs of terrorism, but also on narratives that \n                can positively influence those who may be susceptible \n                to radicalization and recruitment by terrorist \n                organizations.\n\n                The purpose of this Executive Order is to reinforce, \n                integrate, and complement public communications efforts \n                across the executive branch that are (1) focused on \n                countering the actions and ideology of al-Qa'ida, its \n                affiliates and adherents, and other international \n                terrorist organizations and violent extremists \n                overseas, and (2) directed to audiences outside the \n                United States. This collaborative work among executive \n                departments and agencies (agencies) brings together \n                expertise, capabilities, and resources to realize \n                efficiencies and better coordination of U.S. Government \n                communications investments to combat terrorism and \n                extremism.\n\n                Sec. 2.

By partnering with cities and regions \n                to augment their vision for stability and economic \n                growth, the SC2 was designed to help communities \n                strengthen their capacity to create jobs and more \n                competitive business climates, and implement locally \n                driven community and regional planning approaches that \n                lead to sustained economic growth, as well as ensure \n                that Federal assistance is more efficiently provided \n                and used.\n\n                This order improves the way the Federal Government \n                engages with and supports local communities by better \n                aligning resources and coordinating efforts across \n                executive departments and agencies (agencies) so that \n                communities across the country have access to \n                comprehensive, localized technical assistance and \n                planning resources to develop and implement their \n                economic vision and strategies.\n\n                Sec. 2. White House Council on Strong Cities, Strong \n                Communities. There is established a White House Council \n                on Strong Cities, Strong Communities (Council) within \n                the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to be \n                chaired by the Secretary of Housing and Urban \n                Development and the Assistant to the President for \n                Domestic Policy (Co-Chairs).\n\n                    (a) Membership.

Policy. Executive Order 13563 of January 18, \n                2011 (Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review), \n                states that our regulatory system must protect public \n                health, welfare, safety, and our environment while \n                promoting economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, \n                and job creation. In an increasingly global economy, \n                international regulatory cooperation, consistent with \n                domestic law and prerogatives and U.S. trade policy, \n                can be an important means of promoting the goals of \n                Executive Order 13563.\n\n                The regulatory approaches taken by foreign governments \n                may differ from those taken by U.S. regulatory agencies \n                to address similar issues. In some cases, the \n                differences between the regulatory approaches of U.S. \n                agencies and those of their foreign counterparts might \n                not be necessary and might impair the ability of \n                American businesses to export and compete \n                internationally. In meeting shared challenges involving \n                health, safety, labor, security, environmental, and \n                other issues, international regulatory cooperation can \n                identify approaches that are at least as protective as \n                those that are or would be adopted in the absence of \n                such cooperation. International regulatory cooperation \n                can also reduce, eliminate, or prevent unnecessary \n                differences in regulatory requirements.\n\n                Sec. 2. Coordination of International Regulatory \n                Cooperation. (a) The Regulatory Working Group (Working \n                Group) established by Executive Order 12866 of \n                September 30, 1993 (Regulatory Planning and Review), \n                which was reaffirmed by Executive Order 13563, shall, \n                as appropriate:\n\n(i) serve as a forum to discuss, coordinate, and develop a common \nunderstanding among agencies of U.S. Government positions and priorities \nwith respect to:\n\n  (A) international regulatory cooperation activities that are reasonably \nanticipated to lead to significant regulatory actions;\n\n  (B) efforts across the Federal Government to support significant, cross-\ncutting international regulatory cooperation activities, such as the work \nof regulatory cooperation councils; and\n\n  (C) the promotion of good regulatory practices internationally, as well \nas the promotion of U.S. regulatory approaches, as appropriate; and\n\n(ii) examine, among other things:\n\n  (A) appropriate strategies for engaging in the development of regulatory \napproaches through international regulatory cooperation, particularly in \nemerging technology areas, when consistent with section 1 of this order;\n\n  (B) best practices for international regulatory cooperation with respect \nto regulatory development, and, where appropriate, information exchange and \nother regulatory tools; and\n\n  (C) factors that agencies should take into account when determining \nwhether and how to consider other regulatory approaches under section 3(d) \nof this order.\n\n                    (b) As Chair of the Working Group, the \n                Administrator of the Office of Information and \n                Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) of the Office of Management\n\n[[Page 26414]]\n\n                and Budget (OMB) shall convene the Working Group as \n                necessary to discuss international regulatory \n                cooperation issues as described above, and the Working \n                Group shall include a representative from the Office of \n                the United States Trade Representative and, as \n                appropriate, representatives from other agencies and \n                offices.\n                    (c) The activities of the Working Group, consistent \n                with law, shall not duplicate the efforts of existing \n                interagency bodies and coordination mechanisms. The \n                Working Group shall consult with existing interagency \n                bodies when appropriate.\n                    (d) To inform its discussions, and pursuant to \n                section 4 of Executive Order 12866, the Working Group \n                may commission analytical reports and studies by OIRA, \n                the Administrative Conference of the United States, or \n                any other relevant agency, and the Administrator of \n                OIRA may solicit input, from time to time, from \n                representatives of business, nongovernmental \n                organizations, and the public.\n                    (e) The Working Group shall develop and issue \n                guidelines on the applicability and implementation of \n                sections 2 through 4 of this order.\n                    (f) For purposes of this order, the Working Group \n                shall operate by consensus.\n\n                Sec. 3. Responsibilities of Federal Agencies. To the \n                extent permitted by law, and consistent with the \n                principles and requirements of Executive Order 13563 \n                and Executive Order 12866, each agency shall:\n\n                    (a) if required to submit a Regulatory Plan \n                pursuant to Executive Order 12866, include in that plan \n                a summary of its international regulatory cooperation \n                activities that are reasonably anticipated to lead to \n                significant regulations, with an explanation of how \n                these activities advance the purposes of Executive \n                Order 13563 and this order;\n                    (b) ensure that significant regulations that the \n                agency identifies as having significant international \n                impacts are designated as such in the Unified Agenda of \n                Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions, on \n                <a href=\"http://RegInfo.gov\">RegInfo.gov</a>, and on <a href=\"http://Regulations.gov\">Regulations.gov</a>;\n                    (c) in selecting which regulations to include in \n                its retrospective review plan, as required by Executive \n                Order 13563, consider:\n\n(i) reforms to existing significant regulations that address unnecessary \ndifferences in regulatory requirements between the United States and its \nmajor trading partners, consistent with section 1 of this order, when \nstakeholders provide adequate information to the agency establishing that \nthe differences are unnecessary; and\n\n(ii) such reforms in other circumstances as the agency deems appropriate; \nand\n\n                    (d) for significant regulations that the agency \n                identifies as having significant international impacts, \n                consider, to the extent feasible, appropriate, and \n                consistent with law, any regulatory approaches by a \n                foreign government that the United States has agreed to \n                consider under a regulatory cooperation council work \n                plan.\n\n                Sec. 4.

Purpose. When the Federal Government makes \n                payments to individuals and businesses as program \n                beneficiaries, grantees, or contractors, or on behalf \n                of program beneficiaries, it must make every effort to \n                confirm that the right recipient is receiving the right \n                payment for the right reason at the right time. The \n                purpose of this order is to reduce improper payments by \n                intensifying efforts to eliminate payment error, waste, \n                fraud, and abuse in the major programs administered by \n                the Federal Government, while continuing to ensure that \n                Federal programs serve and provide access to their \n                intended beneficiaries. No single step will fully \n                achieve these goals. Therefore, this order adopts a \n                comprehensive set of policies, including transparency \n                and public scrutiny of significant payment errors \n                throughout the Federal Government; a focus on \n                identifying and eliminating the highest improper \n                payments; accountability for reducing improper payments \n                among executive branch agencies and officials; and \n                coordinated Federal, State, and local government action \n                in identifying and eliminating improper payments. \n                Because this order targets error, waste, fraud, and \n                abuse--not legitimate use of Government services--\n                efforts to reduce improper payments under this order \n                must protect access to Federal programs by their \n                intended beneficiaries.\n\n                Sec. 2. Transparency and Public Participation.\n\n                (a) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the \n                Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) \n                shall:\n\n(i) identify Federal programs in which the highest dollar value or majority \nof Government-wide improper payments occur (high-priority programs);\n\n(ii) establish, in coordination with the executive department or agency \n(agency) responsible for administering the high-priority program annual or \nsemi-annual targets (or where such targets already exist, supplemental \ntargets), as appropriate, for reducing improper payments associated with \neach high-priority program;\n\n(iii) issue Government-wide guidance on the implementation of this order, \nincluding procedures for identifying and publicizing the list of entities \ndescribed in subsection (b)(v) of this section and for administrative \nappeal of the decision to publish the identity of those entities, prior to \npublication; and\n\n(iv) establish a working group consisting of Federal, State, and local \nofficials to make recommendations to the Director of OMB designed to \nimprove the Federal Government's measurement of access to Federal programs \nby the programs' intended beneficiaries. The working group's \nrecommendations shall be prepared in consultation with the Council of \nInspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) and submitted within \n180 days of the date of this order, and the recommended measurements may be \nincorporated by the Secretary of the Treasury in the information published \npursuant to subsection (b) of this section.\n\n                (b) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the \n                Secretary of the Treasury in coordination with the \n                Attorney General and the Director of OMB, shall\n\n[[Page 62202]]\n\n                publish on the Internet information about improper \n                payments under high-priority programs.

Agency Accountability and Coordination.\n\n                (a) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the head \n                of each agency responsible for operating a high-\n                priority program shall designate an official who holds \n                an existing Senate-confirmed position to be accountable \n                for meeting the targets established under section 2 of \n                this order without unduly burdening program access and \n                participation by eligible beneficiaries. In those \n                agencies where the majority of payments are isolated to \n                a single component, the head of the agency shall name a \n                second accountable official for that component whose \n                sole responsibility would be for program integrity \n                activities and, as appropriate, shall consolidate and \n                coordinate all program integrity activities within the \n                component.\n\n                (b) Within 180 days of the date of this order, each \n                agency official designated under subsection (a) of this \n                section, or otherwise designated by the Director of \n                OMB, shall provide the agency's Inspector General a \n                report containing:\n\n(i) the agency's methodology for identifying and measuring improper \npayments by the agency's high-priority programs;\n\n(ii) the agency's plans, together with supporting analysis, for meeting the \nreduction targets for improper payments in the agency's high-priority \nprograms; and\n\n(iii) the agency's plan, together with supporting analysis, for ensuring \nthat initiatives undertaken pursuant to this order do not unduly burden \nprogram access and participation by eligible beneficiaries.\n\n                Following the receipt and review of this information, \n                the agency Inspector General shall assess the level of \n                risk associated with the applicable programs, determine \n                the extent of oversight warranted, and provide the \n                agency head with recommendations, if any, for modifying \n                the agency's methodology,\n\n[[Page 62203]]\n\n                improper payment reduction plans, or program access and \n                participation plans.\n\n                (c) If an agency fails to meet the targets established \n                under section 2 of this order or implement the plan \n                described in subsection (b)(iii) of this section for 2 \n                consecutive years, that agency's accountable official \n                designated under subsection (a) of this section shall \n                submit to the agency head, Inspector General, and Chief \n                Financial Officer a report describing the likely causes \n                of the agency's failure and proposing a remedial plan. \n                The agency head shall review this plan and, in \n                consultation with the Inspector General and Chief \n                Financial Officer, forward the plan with any additional \n                comments and analysis to the Director of OMB.\n\n                (d) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the \n                Chief Financial Officers Council (CFOC) in consultation \n                with the CIGIE, the Department of Justice, and program \n                experts, shall make recommendations to the Director of \n                OMB and the Secretary of the Treasury on actions \n                (including actions related to forensic accounting and \n                audits) agencies should take to more effectively tailor \n                their methodologies for identifying and measuring \n                improper payments to those programs, or components of \n                programs, where improper payments are most likely to \n                occur. Recommendations shall address the manner in \n                which the recommended actions would affect program \n                access and participation by eligible beneficiaries.\n\n                (e) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the \n                Secretary of the Treasury and the Director of OMB in \n                consultation with the CIGIE, the Department of Justice, \n                and program experts, shall recommend to the President \n                actions designed to reduce improper payments by \n                improving information sharing among agencies and \n                programs, and where applicable, State and local \n                governments and other stakeholders. The recommendations \n                shall address the ways in which information sharing may \n                improve eligibility verification and pre-payment \n                scrutiny, shall identify legal or regulatory \n                impediments to effective information sharing, and shall \n                address the manner in which the recommended actions \n                would affect program access and participation by \n                eligible beneficiaries.\n\n                (f) Within 180 days of the date of this order, and at \n                least once every quarter thereafter, the head of each \n                agency shall submit to the agency's Inspector General \n                and the CIGIE, and make available to the public, a \n                report on any high-dollar improper payments identified \n                by the agency, subject to Federal privacy policies and \n                to the extent permitted by law. The report shall \n                describe any actions the agency has taken or plans to \n                take to recover improper payments, as well as any \n                actions the agency intends to take to prevent improper \n                payments from occurring in the future. The report shall \n                not include any referrals the agency made or \n                anticipates making to the Department of Justice, or any \n                information provided in connection with such referrals. \n                Following the review of each report, the agency \n                Inspector General and the CIGIE shall assess the level \n                of risk associated with the applicable program, \n                determine the extent of oversight warranted, and \n                provide the agency head with recommendations, if any, \n                for modifying the agency's plans.\n\n                Sec. 4. Enhanced Focus on Contractors and Working with \n                State and Local Stakeholders.\n\n                (a) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the \n                Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, in coordination \n                with the Director of OMB, and in consultation with the \n                National Procurement Fraud Task Force (or its successor \n                group), the CIGIE, and appropriate agency officials, \n                shall recommend to the President actions designed to \n                enhance contractor accountability for improper \n                payments. The recommendations may include, but are not \n                limited to, subjecting contractors to debarment, \n                suspension, financial penalties, and identification \n                through a public Internet website, subject to Federal \n                privacy policies and to the extent permitted by law and \n                where the identification would not interfere with or \n                compromise an ongoing criminal or civil investigation, \n                for knowingly failing timely to disclose credible \n                evidence of significant overpayments received on \n                Government contracts.\n\n[[Page 62204]]\n\n                (b) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the \n                Director of OMB shall establish a working group \n                consisting of Federal and elected State and local \n                officials to make recommendations to the Director of \n                OMB designed to improve the effectiveness of single \n                audits of State and local governments and non-profit \n                organizations that are expending Federal funds. The \n                Director of OMB may designate an appropriate official \n                to serve as Chair of the working group to convene its \n                meetings and direct its work. The working group's \n                recommendations shall be prepared in consultation with \n                the CIGIE and submitted within 180 days of the date of \n                this order. The recommendations shall address, among \n                other things, the effectiveness of single audits in \n                identifying improper payments and opportunities to \n                streamline or eliminate single audit requirements where \n                their value is minimal.\n\n                (c) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the \n                Director of OMB shall establish a working group (which \n                may be separate from the group established under \n                subsection (b) of this section) consisting of Federal \n                and elected State and local officials to make \n                recommendations to the Director of OMB for \n                administrative actions designed to improve the \n                incentives and accountability of State and local \n                governments, as well as other entities receiving \n                Federal funds, for reducing improper payments. The \n                Director of OMB may designate an appropriate official \n                to serve as Chair of the working group to convene its \n                meetings and direct its work.

Policy. Executive Order 13554 of October 5, \n                2010, was issued after the blowout and explosion of the \n                mobile offshore drilling unit Deepwater Horizon that \n                occurred on April 20, 2010, and resulted in the largest \n                oil spill in U.S. history (Deepwater Horizon Oil \n                Spill). Executive Order 13554 recognized the Gulf Coast \n                as a national treasure and addressed the longstanding \n                ecological decline of that region, which was compounded \n                by the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. In doing so, \n                Executive Order 13554 established a Gulf Coast \n                Ecosystem Restoration Task Force (Task Force) to \n                coordinate intergovernmental efforts, planning, and the \n                exchange of information in order to better implement \n                Gulf Coast ecosystem restoration and facilitate \n                appropriate accountability and support throughout the \n                restoration process.\n\n                Since the implementation of Executive Order 13554, the \n                Federal Government's Gulf Coast ecosystem restoration \n                planning efforts have advanced significantly. The Task \n                Force's Gulf of Mexico Regional Ecosystem Restoration \n                Strategy (Strategy), created with input from Federal, \n                State, tribal, and local governments, and thousands of \n                involved citizens and organizations across the region, \n                serves as a comprehensive restoration plan for \n                addressing ecological concerns in the Gulf of Mexico. \n                In light of the release of the Strategy, the ongoing \n                work of the Natural Resource Damage Trustee Council \n                (Trustee Council) under the Oil Pollution Act, and the \n                recent passage of the Resources and Ecosystems \n                Sustainability, Tourist Opportunities, and Revived \n                Economies of the Gulf Coast States Act of 2012 (RESTORE \n                Act) (title I, subtitle F of Public Law 112-141), this \n                order affirms the Federal Government's Gulf Coast \n                ecosystem restoration efforts and realigns \n                responsibilities to ensure the most effective \n                governmental planning and coordination to reach these \n                goals.\n\n                Sec. 2. Termination of the Gulf Coast Ecosystem \n                Restoration Task Force. The progress of the Task Force \n                is noteworthy. It has completed the Strategy and the \n                preliminary planning and coordination tasks that it was \n                intended to produce and has significantly advanced \n                important ecosystem restoration goals for the Gulf of \n                Mexico. In light of the recent creation, described \n                below, of the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council \n                (Gulf Restoration Council), which will build upon the \n                Task Force's already successful collaboration between \n                Federal, State, and tribal governments and, as directed \n                by statute, include and incorporate in its proposed \n                comprehensive plan the findings and information \n                prepared by the Task Force, the Task Force shall \n                terminate no later than 60 days after the Gulf \n                Restoration Council commences its work. The functions \n                of the Task Force will be performed by the Gulf \n                Restoration Council and the Trustee Council to the \n                extent practicable, as set forth in this order. Prior \n                to its termination, the Task Force will provide such \n                assistance as is appropriate to the Gulf Restoration \n                Council.\n\n[[Page 56750]]\n\n                Sec. 3. The Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund and the \n                Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council.\n\n                    (a) Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund. The RESTORE \n                Act, which was signed into law as part of the Moving \n                Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (Public Law \n                112-141), established a mechanism for providing funding \n                to the Gulf region to restore ecosystems and rebuild \n                local economies damaged by the Deepwater Horizon Oil \n                Spill. The RESTORE Act established in the Treasury of \n                the United States the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund \n                (Trust Fund), consisting of 80 percent of an amount \n                equal to any administrative and civil penalties paid \n                after the date of the RESTORE Act by the responsible \n                parties in connection with the Deepwater Horizon Oil \n                Spill to the United States pursuant to a court order, \n                negotiated settlement, or other instrument in \n                accordance with section 311 of the FWPCA (33 U.S.C. \n                1321).\n                    (b) Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council. The \n                RESTORE Act established the Gulf Restoration Council, \n                an independent entity charged with developing a \n                comprehensive plan for ecosystem restoration in the \n                Gulf Coast (Comprehensive Plan), as well as any future \n                revisions to the Comprehensive Plan. Among its other \n                duties, the Gulf Restoration Council is tasked with \n                identifying projects and programs aimed at restoring \n                and protecting the natural resources and ecosystems of \n                the Gulf Coast region, to be funded from a portion of \n                the Trust Fund; establishing such other advisory \n                committees as may be necessary to assist the Gulf \n                Restoration Council, including a scientific advisory \n                committee and a committee to advise the Gulf \n                Restoration Council on public policy issues; gathering \n                information relevant to Gulf Coast restoration, \n                including through research, modeling, and monitoring; \n                and providing an annual report to the Congress on \n                implementation progress. Consistent with the RESTORE \n                Act, the Comprehensive Plan developed by the Gulf \n                Restoration Council will include provisions necessary \n                to fully incorporate the Strategy, projects, and \n                programs recommended by the Task Force.\n                    (c) Federal members of the Gulf Restoration Council \n                and Trustee Council, as well as all Federal entities \n                involved in Gulf Coast restoration, shall work closely \n                with one another to advance their common goals, reduce \n                duplication, and maximize consistency among their \n                efforts. All Federal members are directed to consult \n                with each other and with all non-federal members in \n                carrying out their duties on the Gulf Restoration \n                Council.\n\n                Sec. 4. Ongoing Role of the Natural Resource Damage \n                Assessment Trustee Council. (a) Executive Order 13554 \n                recognized the role of the Trustee Council, and \n                designated trustees as provided in 33 U.S.C. 2706, with \n                trusteeship over natural resources injured, lost, or \n                destroyed as a result of the Deepwater Horizon Oil \n                Spill. Specifically, Executive Order 13554 recognized \n                the importance of carefully coordinating the work of \n                the Task Force with the Trustee Council, whose members \n                have statutory responsibility to assess natural \n                resources damages from the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, \n                to restore trust resources, and seek compensation for \n                lost use of those trust resources. Section 3(b) of \n                Executive Order 13554 instructed the Task Force to \n                ``support the Natural Resource Damage Assessment \n                process by referring potential ecosystem restoration \n                actions to the * * * Trustee Council for consideration \n                and facilitating coordination among the relevant \n                departments, agencies, and offices, as appropriate, \n                subject to the independent statutory responsibilities \n                of the trustees.'' The Department of Commerce (through \n                the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), \n                the Department of the Interior (through the Fish and \n                Wildlife Service and the National Park Service), and \n                the Department of Justice have worked to identify \n                linkages and opportunities for the Task Force to \n                complement the restoration progress of the Trustee \n                Council.\n\n                    (b) Section 7(e) of Executive Order 13554 provides \n                that nothing in that order shall interfere with the \n                statutory responsibilities and authority of the Trustee \n                Council or the individual trustees to carry out their \n                statutory responsibilities to assess natural resource \n                damages and implement restoration actions under 33 \n                U.S.C. 2706 and other applicable law. Agencies that \n                were members of the Task Force shall continue to comply \n                with these requirements.\n\n\n[[Page 56751]]\n\n\n\n                Sec. 5. Designating Trustees for Natural Resource \n                Damage Assessment. Given their authorities, programs, \n                and expertise, the Environmental Protection Agency \n                (EPA) and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) have \n                institutional capacities that can contribute \n                significantly to the Natural Resource Damage Assessment \n                and restoration efforts, including scientific and \n                policy expertise as well as experience gained in the \n                Task Force process and other planning efforts in the \n                Gulf area. In addition, EPA's and USDA's relevant \n                authorities cover a range of natural resources and \n                their supporting ecosystems, including waters, \n                sediments, barrier islands, wetlands, soils, land \n                management, air resources, and drinking water supplies. \n                The inclusion of EPA and USDA as trustees participating \n                in the Natural Resource Damage Assessment and \n                restoration efforts will maximize coordination across \n                the Federal Government and enhance overall efficiencies \n                regarding Gulf Coast ecosystem restoration. \n                Accordingly, without limiting the designations in \n                Executive Order 12777 of October 18, 1991, or any other \n                existing designations, and pursuant to section \n                2706(b)(2) of title 33, United States Code, I hereby \n                designate the Administrator of EPA and the Secretary of \n                Agriculture as additional trustees for Natural Resource \n                Damage Assessment and restoration solely in connection \n                with injury to, destruction of, loss of, or loss of use \n                of natural resources, including their supporting \n                ecosystems, resulting from the Deepwater Horizon Oil \n                Spill. The addition of these Federal trustees does not, \n                in and of itself, alter any existing agreements among \n                or between the trustees and any other entity. All \n                Federal trustees are directed to consult, coordinate, \n                and cooperate with each other in carrying out all of \n                their trustee duties and responsibilities.\n\n                The Administrator of EPA is hereby directed to revise \n                Subpart G of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances \n                Pollution Contingency Plan to reflect the designations \n                for the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill discussed in this \n                section.\n\n                Sec. 6.

The Government \n                of Burma has made progress towards political reform in \n                a number of areas, including by releasing hundreds of \n                political prisoners, pursuing ceasefire talks with \n                several armed ethnic groups, and pursuing a substantive \n                dialogue with the democratic opposition. Recognizing \n                that such reform is fragile, I hereby find that the \n                continued detention of political prisoners, efforts to \n                undermine or obstruct the political reform process, \n                efforts to undermine or obstruct the peace process with \n                ethnic minorities, military trade with North Korea, and \n                human rights abuses in Burma particularly in ethnic \n                areas, effectuated by persons within or outside the \n                Government of Burma, constitute an unusual and \n                extraordinary threat to the national security and \n                foreign policy of the United States. Accordingly, I \n                hereby order:\n\n                Section 1.

The prohibitions in section 1 of this order \n                include but are not limited to: (a) the making of any \n                contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services \n                by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property \n                and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this \n                order; and\n\n                    (b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of \n                funds, goods, or services from any such person.\n\n                Sec. 5. I hereby find that the unrestricted immigrant \n                and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens \n                determined to meet one or more of the criteria in \n                subsection 1(a) of this order would be detrimental to \n                the interests of the United States, and I hereby \n                suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants or \n                nonimmigrants, of such persons. Such persons shall be \n                treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation \n                8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens \n                Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans \n                and International Emergency Economic Powers Act \n                Sanctions).\n\n                Sec. 6.

(a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has \n                the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation \n                of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set \n                forth in this order is prohibited.\n\n                    (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the \n                prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.\n\n                Sec. 8. For the purposes of this order: (a) the term \n                ``person'' means an individual or entity;\n\n                    (b) The term ``entity'' means a partnership, \n                association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, \n                subgroup, or other organization; and\n                    (c) the term ``United States person'' means any \n                United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity \n                organized under the laws of the United States or any \n                jurisdiction within the United States (including \n                foreign branches), or any person in the United States.\n\n                Sec. 9. For those persons whose property and interests \n                in property are blocked pursuant to this order who \n                might have a constitutional presence\n\n[[Page 41245]]\n\n                in the United States, I find that because of the \n                ability to transfer funds or other assets \n                instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of \n                measures to be taken pursuant to this order would \n                render those measures ineffectual. I therefore \n                determine that for these measures to be effective in \n                addressing the national emergency declared in Executive \n                Order 13047, as modified in scope in Executive Order \n                13448 and in this order, there need be no prior notice \n                of a listing or determination made pursuant to section \n                1 of this order.\n\n                Sec. 10. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to \n                take such actions, including the promulgation of rules \n                and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to \n                the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out \n                the purposes of this order.

Purpose. Hurricane Sandy made landfall on \n                October 29, 2012, resulting in major flooding, \n                extensive structural damage, and significant loss of \n                life. A dangerous nor'easter followed 9 days later \n                causing additional damage and undermining the recovery \n                effort. As a result of these events, thousands of \n                individuals were displaced and millions lost power, \n                some for an extended period of time. Over 1,600 stores \n                were closed, and fuel distribution was severely \n                disrupted, further complicating the recovery effort. \n                New York and New Jersey--two of the Nation's most \n                populous States--were especially hard hit by these \n                storms.\n\n                The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the \n                Department of Homeland Security is leading the recovery \n                efforts to assist the affected region. A disaster of \n                Hurricane Sandy's magnitude merits a comprehensive and \n                collaborative approach to the long-term rebuilding \n                plans for this critical region and its infrastructure. \n                Rebuilding efforts must address economic conditions and \n                the region's aged infrastructure--including its public \n                housing, transportation systems, and utilities--and \n                identify the requirements and resources necessary to \n                bring these systems to a more resilient condition given \n                both current and future risks.\n\n                This order establishes the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding \n                Task Force (Task Force) to provide the coordination \n                that is necessary to support these rebuilding \n                objectives. In collaboration with the leadership \n                provided through the National Disaster Recovery \n                Framework (NDRF), the Task Force will identify \n                opportunities for achieving rebuilding success, \n                consistent with the NDRF's commitment to support \n                economic vitality, enhance public health and safety, \n                protect and enhance natural and manmade infrastructure, \n                and ensure appropriate accountability. The Task Force \n                will work to ensure that the Federal Government \n                continues to provide appropriate resources to support \n                affected State, local, and tribal communities to \n                improve the region's resilience, health, and prosperity \n                by building for the future.\n\n                Sec. 2. Establishment of the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding \n                Task Force. There is established the Hurricane Sandy \n                Rebuilding Task Force, which shall be chaired by the \n                Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (Chair).\n\n                 (a) In addition to the Chair, the Task Force shall \n                consist of the head of each of the following executive \n                departments, agencies, and offices, or their designated \n                representatives:\n\n(i) the Department of the Treasury;\n\n(ii) the Department of the Interior;\n\n(iii) the Department of Agriculture;\n\n(iv) the Department of Commerce;\n\n(v) the Department of Labor;\n\n(vi) the Department of Health and Human Services;\n\n(vii) the Department of Transportation;\n\n(viii) the Department of Energy;\n\n(ix) the Department of Education;\n\n[[Page 74342]]\n\n(x) the Department of Veterans Affairs;\n\n(xi) the Department of Homeland Security;\n\n(xii) the Environmental Protection Agency;\n\n(xiii) the Small Business Administration;\n\n(xiv) the Army Corps of Engineers;\n\n(xv) the Office of Management and Budget;\n\n(xvi) the National Security Staff;\n\n(xvii) the Domestic Policy Council;\n\n(xviii) the National Economic Council;\n\n(xix) the Council on Environmental Quality;\n\n(xx) the Office of Science and Technology Policy;\n\n(xxi) the Council of Economic Advisers;\n\n(xxii) the White House Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental \nAffairs;\n\n(xxiii) the White House Office of Cabinet Affairs; and\n\n(xxiv) such other agencies and offices as the President may designate.\n\n                    (b) The Chair shall regularly convene and preside \n                at meetings of the Task Force and determine its agenda \n                as the Task Force exercises the functions set forth in \n                section 3 of this order.

It is the policy of the United \n                States to plan and prepare for the timely provision of \n                medical countermeasures to the American people in the \n                event of a biological attack in the United States \n                through a rapid Federal response in coordination with \n                State, local, territorial, and tribal governments.\n\n                This policy would seek to: (1) mitigate illness and \n                prevent death; (2) sustain critical infrastructure; and \n                (3) complement and supplement State, local, \n                territorial, and tribal government medical \n                countermeasure distribution capacity.\n\n                Sec. 2. United States Postal Service Delivery of \n                Medical Countermeasures. (a) The U.S. Postal Service \n                has the capacity for rapid residential delivery of \n                medical countermeasures for self administration across \n                all communities in the United States.

Policy. The industrial sector accounts for \n                over 30 percent of all energy consumed in the United \n                States, and, for many manufacturers, energy costs \n                affect overall competitiveness. While our manufacturing \n                facilities have made progress in becoming more energy \n                efficient over the past several decades, there is an \n                opportunity to accelerate and expand these efforts with \n                investments to reduce energy use through more efficient \n                manufacturing processes and facilities and the expanded \n                use of combined heat and power (CHP). Instead of \n                burning fuel in an on-site boiler to produce thermal \n                energy and also purchasing electricity from the grid, a \n                manufacturing facility can use a CHP system to provide \n                both types of energy in one energy-efficient step. \n                Accelerating these investments in our Nation's \n                factories can improve the competitiveness of United \n                States manufacturing, lower energy costs, free up \n                future capital for businesses to invest, reduce air \n                pollution, and create jobs.\n\n                Despite these benefits, independent studies have \n                pointed to under-investment in industrial energy \n                efficiency and CHP as a result of numerous barriers. \n                The Federal Government has limited but important \n                authorities to overcome these barriers, and our efforts \n                to support investment in industrial energy efficiency \n                and CHP should involve coordinated engagement with a \n                broad set of stakeholders, including States, \n                manufacturers, utilities, and others. By working with \n                all stakeholders to address these barriers, we have an \n                opportunity to save industrial users tens of billions \n                of dollars in energy costs over the next decade.\n\n                There is no one-size-fits-all solution for our \n                manufacturers, so it is imperative that we support \n                these investments through a variety of approaches, \n                including encouraging private sector investment by \n                setting goals and highlighting the benefits of \n                investment, improving coordination at the Federal \n                level, partnering with and supporting States, and \n                identifying investment models beneficial to the \n                multiple stakeholders involved.\n\n                To formalize and support the close interagency \n                coordination that is required to accelerate greater \n                investment in industrial energy efficiency and CHP, \n                this order directs certain executive departments and \n                agencies to convene national and regional stakeholders \n                to identify, develop, and encourage the adoption of \n                investment models and State best practice policies for \n                industrial energy efficiency and CHP; provide technical \n                assistance to States and manufacturers to encourage \n                investment in industrial energy efficiency and CHP; \n                provide public information on the benefits of \n                investment in industrial energy efficiency and CHP; and \n                use existing Federal authorities, programs, and \n                policies to support investment in industrial energy \n                efficiency and CHP.\n\n                Sec. 2.  Encouraging Investment in Industrial \n                Efficiency. The Departments of Energy, Commerce, and \n                Agriculture, and the Environmental Protection Agency, \n                in coordination with the National Economic Council, the \n                Domestic Policy Council, the Council on Environmental \n                Quality, and the Office of Science and Technology \n                Policy, shall coordinate policies to encourage \n                investment in industrial efficiency in order to reduce \n                costs for industrial users,\n\n[[Page 54780]]\n\n                improve U.S. competitiveness, create jobs, and reduce \n                harmful air pollution. In doing so, they shall engage \n                States, industrial companies, utility companies, and \n                other stakeholders to accelerate this investment. \n                Specifically, these agencies shall, as appropriate and \n                consistent with applicable law:\n\n                    (a) coordinate and strongly encourage efforts to \n                achieve a national goal of deploying 40 gigawatts of \n                new, cost-effective industrial CHP in the United States \n                by the end of 2020;\n                    (b) convene stakeholders, through a series of \n                public workshops, to develop and encourage the use of \n                best practice State policies and investment models that \n                address the multiple barriers to investment in \n                industrial energy efficiency and CHP;\n                    (c) utilize their respective relevant authorities \n                and resources to encourage investment in industrial \n                energy efficiency and CHP, such as by:\n\n(i) providing assistance to States on accounting for the potential emission \nreduction benefits of CHP and other energy efficiency policies when \ndeveloping State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to achieve national ambient \nair quality standards;\n\n(ii) providing incentives for the deployment of CHP and other types of \nclean energy, such as set-asides under emissions allowance trading program \nstate implementation plans, grants, and loans;\n\n(iii) employing output-based approaches as compliance options in power and \nindustrial sector regulations, as appropriate, to recognize the emissions \nbenefits of highly efficient energy generation technologies like CHP; and\n\n(iv) seeking to expand participation in and create additional tools to \nsupport the Better Buildings, Better Plants program at the Department of \nEnergy, which is working with companies to help them achieve a goal of \nreducing energy intensity by 25 percent over 10 years, as well as utilizing \nexisting partnership programs to support energy efficiency and CHP;\n\n                    (d) support and encourage efforts to accelerate \n                investment in industrial energy efficiency and CHP by:\n\n(i) providing general guidance, technical analysis and information, and \nfinancial analysis on the value of investment in industrial energy \nefficiency and CHP to States, utilities, and owners and operators of \nindustrial facilities;\n\n(ii) improving the usefulness of Federal data collection and analysis; and\n\n(iii) assisting States in developing and implementing State-specific best \npractice policies that can accelerate investment in industrial energy \nefficiency and CHP.\n\n                In implementing this section, these agencies should \n                consult with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, \n                as appropriate.\n\n                Sec. 3.

General Principles. Openness in government \n                strengthens our democracy, promotes the delivery of \n                efficient and effective services to the public, and \n                contributes to economic growth. As one vital benefit of \n                open government, making information resources easy to \n                find, accessible, and usable can fuel entrepreneurship, \n                innovation, and scientific discovery that improves \n                Americans' lives and contributes significantly to job \n                creation.\n\n                Decades ago, the U.S. Government made both weather data \n                and the Global Positioning System freely available. \n                Since that time, American entrepreneurs and innovators \n                have utilized these resources to create navigation \n                systems, weather newscasts and warning systems, \n                location-based applications, precision farming tools, \n                and much more, improving Americans' lives in countless \n                ways and leading to economic growth and job creation. \n                In recent years, thousands of Government data resources \n                across fields such as health and medicine, education, \n                energy, public safety, global development, and finance \n                have been posted in machine-readable form for free \n                public use on <a href=\"http://Data.gov\">Data.gov</a>. Entrepreneurs and innovators \n                have continued to develop a vast range of useful new \n                products and businesses using these public information \n                resources, creating good jobs in the process.\n\n                To promote continued job growth, Government efficiency, \n                and the social good that can be gained from opening \n                Government data to the public, the default state of new \n                and modernized Government information resources shall \n                be open and machine readable. Government information \n                shall be managed as an asset throughout its life cycle \n                to promote interoperability and openness, and, wherever \n                possible and legally permissible, to ensure that data \n                are released to the public in ways that make the data \n                easy to find, accessible, and usable. In making this \n                the new default state, executive departments and \n                agencies (agencies) shall ensure that they safeguard \n                individual privacy, confidentiality, and national \n                security.\n\n                Sec. 2.

(a) The Director of the \n                Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in consultation \n                with the Chief Information Officer (CIO), Chief \n                Technology Officer (CTO), and Administrator of the \n                Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), \n                shall issue an Open Data Policy to advance the \n                management of Government information as an asset, \n                consistent with my memorandum of January 21, 2009 \n                (Transparency and Open Government), OMB Memorandum M-\n                10-06 (Open Government Directive), OMB and National \n                Archives and Records Administration Memorandum M-12-18 \n                (Managing Government Records Directive), the Office of \n                Science and Technology Policy Memorandum of February \n                22, 2013 (Increasing Access to the Results of Federally \n                Funded Scientific Research), and the CIO's strategy \n                entitled ``Digital Government: Building a 21st Century \n                Platform to Better Serve the American People.'' The \n                Open Data Policy shall be updated as needed.\n\n                    (b) Agencies shall implement the requirements of \n                the Open Data Policy and shall adhere to the deadlines \n                for specific actions specified therein. When \n                implementing the Open Data Policy, agencies shall \n                incorporate a full analysis of privacy, \n                confidentiality, and security risks into each stage\n\n[[Page 28112]]\n\n                of the information lifecycle to identify information \n                that should not be released. These review processes \n                should be overseen by the senior agency official for \n                privacy. It is vital that agencies not release \n                information if doing so would violate any law or \n                policy, or jeopardize privacy, confidentiality, or \n                national security.\n\n                Sec. 3. Implementation of the Open Data Policy. To \n                facilitate effective Government-wide implementation of \n                the Open Data Policy, I direct the following:\n\n                    (a) Within 30 days of the issuance of the Open Data \n                Policy, the CIO and CTO shall publish an open online \n                repository of tools and best practices to assist \n                agencies in integrating the Open Data Policy into their \n                operations in furtherance of their missions. The CIO \n                and CTO shall regularly update this online repository \n                as needed to ensure it remains a resource to facilitate \n                the adoption of open data practices.\n                    (b) Within 90 days of the issuance of the Open Data \n                Policy, the Administrator for Federal Procurement \n                Policy, Controller of the Office of Federal Financial \n                Management, CIO, and Administrator of OIRA shall work \n                with the Chief Acquisition Officers Council, Chief \n                Financial Officers Council, Chief Information Officers \n                Council, and Federal Records Council to identify and \n                initiate implementation of measures to support the \n                integration of the Open Data Policy requirements into \n                Federal acquisition and grant-making processes. Such \n                efforts may include developing sample requirements \n                language, grant and contract language, and workforce \n                tools for agency acquisition, grant, and information \n                management and technology professionals.\n                    (c) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the \n                Chief Performance Officer (CPO) shall work with the \n                President's Management Council to establish a Cross-\n                Agency Priority (CAP) Goal to track implementation of \n                the Open Data Policy. The CPO shall work with agencies \n                to set incremental performance goals, ensuring they \n                have metrics and milestones in place to monitor \n                advancement toward the CAP Goal. Progress on these \n                goals shall be analyzed and reviewed by agency \n                leadership, pursuant to the GPRA Modernization Act of \n                2010 (Public Law 111-352).\n                    (d) Within 180 days of the date of this order, \n                agencies shall report progress on the implementation of \n                the CAP Goal to the CPO. Thereafter, agencies shall \n                report progress quarterly, and as appropriate.\n\n                Sec. 4. General Provisions.

More than 20 million men, women, and \n                children throughout the world are victims of severe \n                forms of trafficking in persons (``trafficking'' or \n                ``trafficking in persons'')--defined in section 103 of \n                the TVPA, 22 U.S.C. 7102(8), to include sex trafficking \n                in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, \n                fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to \n                perform such act has not attained 18 years of age, or \n                the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, \n                or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through \n                the use of force, fraud, or coercion, for the purpose \n                of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt \n                bondage, or slavery.\n\n                The United States has long had a zero-tolerance policy \n                regarding Government employees and contractor personnel \n                engaging in any form of this criminal behavior. As the \n                largest single purchaser of goods and services in the \n                world, the United States Government bears a \n                responsibility to ensure that taxpayer dollars do not \n                contribute to trafficking in persons. By providing our \n                Government workforce with additional tools and training \n                to apply and enforce existing policy, and by providing \n                additional clarity to Government contractors and \n                subcontractors on the steps necessary to fully comply \n                with that policy, this order will help to protect \n                vulnerable individuals as contractors and \n                subcontractors perform vital services and manufacture \n                the goods procured by the United States.\n\n                In addition, the improved safeguards provided by this \n                order to strengthen compliance with anti-trafficking \n                laws will promote economy and efficiency in Government \n                procurement. These safeguards, which have been largely \n                modeled on successful practices in the private sector, \n                will increase stability, productivity, and certainty in \n                Federal contracting by avoiding the disruption and \n                disarray caused by the use of trafficked labor and \n                resulting investigative and enforcement actions.\n\n                Sec. 2. Anti-Trafficking Provisions. (a) Within 180 \n                days of the date of this order, the Federal Acquisition \n                Regulatory (FAR) Council, in consultation with the \n                Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary \n                of Labor, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the \n                Administrator for the United States Agency for \n                International Development, and the heads of such other \n                executive departments and agencies (agencies) as the \n                FAR Council determines to be appropriate, shall take \n                steps necessary to amend the Federal Acquisition \n                Regulation to:\n\n                    (1) strengthen the efficacy of the Government's \n                zero-tolerance policy on trafficking in persons by \n                Federal contractors and subcontractors in \n                solicitations, contracts, and subcontracts for supplies \n                or services (including construction and commercial \n                items), by:\n\n(A) expressly prohibiting Federal contractors, contractor employees, \nsubcontractors, and subcontractor employees from engaging in any of the \nfollowing types of trafficking-related activities:\n\n[[Page 60030]]\n\n  (i) using misleading or fraudulent recruitment practices during the \nrecruitment of employees, such as failing to disclose basic information or \nmaking material misrepresentations regarding the key terms and conditions \nof employment, including wages and fringe benefits, the location of work, \nliving conditions and housing (if employer provided or arranged), any \nsignificant costs to be charged to the employee, and, if applicable, the \nhazardous nature of the work;\n\n  (ii) charging employees recruitment fees;\n\n  (iii) destroying, concealing, confiscating, or otherwise denying access \nby an employee to the employee's identity documents, such as passports or \ndrivers' licenses;

Purpose. The ocean, our coasts, and the \n                Great Lakes provide jobs, food, energy resources, \n                ecological services, recreation, and tourism \n                opportunities, and play critical roles in our Nation's \n                transportation, economy, and trade, as well as the \n                global mobility of our Armed Forces and the maintenance \n                of international peace and security. The Deepwater \n                Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and resulting \n                environmental crisis is a stark reminder of how \n                vulnerable our marine environments are, and how much \n                communities and the Nation rely on healthy and \n                resilient ocean and coastal ecosystems. America's \n                stewardship of the ocean, our coasts, and the Great \n                Lakes is intrinsically linked to environmental \n                sustainability, human health and well-being, national \n                prosperity, adaptation to climate and other \n                environmental changes, social justice, international \n                diplomacy, and national and homeland security.\n\n                This order adopts the recommendations of the \n                Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force, except where \n                otherwise provided in this order, and directs executive \n                agencies to implement those recommendations under the \n                guidance of a National Ocean Council. Based on those \n                recommendations, this order establishes a national \n                policy to ensure the protection, maintenance, and \n                restoration of the health of ocean, coastal, and Great \n                Lakes ecosystems and resources, enhance the \n                sustainability of ocean and coastal economies, preserve \n                our maritime heritage, support sustainable uses and \n                access, provide for adaptive management to enhance our \n                understanding of and capacity to respond to climate \n                change and ocean acidification, and coordinate with our \n                national security and foreign policy interests.\n\n                This order also provides for the development of coastal \n                and marine spatial plans that build upon and improve \n                existing Federal, State, tribal, local, and regional \n                decisionmaking and planning processes. These regional \n                plans will enable a more integrated, comprehensive, \n                ecosystem-based, flexible, and proactive approach to \n                planning and managing sustainable multiple uses across \n                sectors and improve the conservation of the ocean, our \n                coasts, and the Great Lakes.\n\n                Sec. 2. Policy. (a) To achieve an America whose \n                stewardship ensures that the ocean, our coasts, and the \n                Great Lakes are healthy and resilient, safe and \n                productive, and understood and treasured so as to \n                promote the well-being, prosperity, and security of \n                present and future generations, it is the policy of the \n                United States to:\n\n(i) protect, maintain, and restore the health and biological diversity of \nocean, coastal, and Great Lakes ecosystems and resources;\n\n(ii) improve the resiliency of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes ecosystems, \ncommunities, and economies;\n\n(iii) bolster the conservation and sustainable uses of land in ways that \nwill improve the health of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes ecosystems;\n\n(iv) use the best available science and knowledge to inform decisions \naffecting the ocean, our coasts, and the Great Lakes, and enhance \nhumanity's capacity to understand, respond, and adapt to a changing global \nenvironment;\n\n[[Page 43024]]\n\n(v) support sustainable, safe, secure, and productive access to, and uses \nof the ocean, our coasts, and the Great Lakes;\n\n(vi) respect and preserve our Nation's maritime heritage, including our \nsocial, cultural, recreational, and historical values;\n\n(vii) exercise rights and jurisdiction and perform duties in accordance \nwith applicable international law, including respect for and preservation \nof navigational rights and freedoms, which are essential for the global \neconomy and international peace and security;\n\n(viii) increase scientific understanding of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes \necosystems as part of the global interconnected systems of air, land, ice, \nand water, including their relationships to humans and their activities;\n\n(ix) improve our understanding and awareness of changing environmental \nconditions, trends, and their causes, and of human activities taking place \nin ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes waters; and\n\n(x) foster a public understanding of the value of the ocean, our coasts, \nand the Great Lakes to build a foundation for improved stewardship.\n\n                    (b) The United States shall promote this policy by:\n\n(i) ensuring a comprehensive and collaborative framework for the \nstewardship of the ocean, our coasts, and the Great Lakes that facilitates \ncohesive actions across the Federal Government, as well as participation of \nState, tribal, and local authorities, regional governance structures, \nnongovernmental organizations, the public, and the private sector;\n\n(ii) cooperating and exercising leadership at the international level;\n\n(iii) pursuing the United States' accession to the Law of the Sea \nConvention; and\n\n(iv) supporting ocean stewardship in a fiscally responsible manner.\n\n                Sec. 3. Definitions. As used in this order:\n\n                    (a) ``Final Recommendations'' means the Final \n                Recommendations of the Interagency Ocean Policy Task \n                Force that shall be made publicly available and for \n                which a notice of public availability shall be \n                published in the Federal Register.\n                    (b) The term ``coastal and marine spatial \n                planning'' means a comprehensive, adaptive, integrated, \n                ecosystem-based, and transparent spatial planning \n                process, based on sound science, for analyzing current \n                and anticipated uses of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes \n                areas. Coastal and marine spatial planning identifies \n                areas most suitable for various types or classes of \n                activities in order to reduce conflicts among uses, \n                reduce environmental impacts, facilitate compatible \n                uses, and preserve critical ecosystem services to meet \n                economic, environmental, security, and social \n                objectives. In practical terms, coastal and marine \n                spatial planning provides a public policy process for \n                society to better determine how the ocean, our coasts, \n                and Great Lakes are sustainably used and protected--now \n                and for future generations.\n                    (c) The term ``coastal and marine spatial plans'' \n                means the plans that are certified by the National \n                Ocean Council as developed in accordance with the \n                definition, goals, principles, and process described in \n                the Final Recommendations.\n\n                Sec. 4.

For the purposes of this order:\n                    (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or \n                entity;\n                    (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, \n                association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, \n                subgroup, or other organization; and\n                    (c) the term ``United States person'' means any \n                United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity \n                organized under the laws of the United States or any \n                jurisdiction within the United States (including \n                foreign branches), or any person in the United States.\n\n                Sec. 7. For those persons whose property and interests \n                in property are blocked pursuant to this order who \n                might have a constitutional presence in the United \n                States, I find that because of the ability to transfer \n                funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to \n                such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this \n                order would render those measures ineffectual. I \n                therefore determine that for these measures to be \n                effective in addressing the national emergency declared \n                in this order, there need be no prior notice of a \n                listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of \n                this order.\n\n                Sec. 8. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to \n                take such actions, including the promulgation of rules \n                and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to \n                the President by IEEPA and the UNPA, as may be \n                necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The \n                Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these \n                functions to other officers and agencies of the United \n                States Government consistent with applicable law. All \n                agencies of the United States Government are hereby \n                directed to take all appropriate measures within their \n                authority to carry out the provisions of this order.\n\n                Sec. 9. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to \n                determine that circumstances no longer warrant the \n                blocking of the property and interests in property of a \n                person listed in the Annex to this order, and to take \n                necessary action to give effect to that determination.\n\n                Sec. 10. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to \n                submit the recurring and final reports to the Congress \n                on the national emergency declared in this order, \n                consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. \n                1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. \n                1703(c)).\n\n[[Page 28390]]\n\n                Sec. 11.

Policy. The United States recognizes that \n                Africa is a region of growing economic opportunity and \n                innovation and aims to expand a trade and investment \n                partnership that is grounded in shared interests and \n                mutual responsibility. Africa offers a diverse and \n                broad range of trade and investment opportunities in \n                national and regional markets. The U.S. Government will \n                encourage U.S. companies to seize the trade and \n                investment opportunities offered by Africa's national \n                and regional markets and help drive inclusive and \n                sustained economic growth and the region's economic \n                expansion, while also creating jobs here in the United \n                States.\n\n                Sec. 2. Establishment. Not later than 180 days after \n                the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce shall \n                establish the President's Advisory Council on Doing \n                Business in Africa (Advisory Council).\n\n                Sec. 3.

Appointments to the Advisory Council shall be \n                made without regard to political affiliation.\n\n                    (b) Members of the Advisory Council shall be \n                appointed by the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation \n                with the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC), \n                which was authorized by statute in 1992 (15 U.S.C. \n                4727) and established by Executive Order 12870 of \n                September 30, 1993.\n\n                Sec. 4.

Policy. At more than 52 million strong, \n                including 4 million in Puerto Rico, Hispanics \n                constitute the country's largest and fastest growing \n                minority group. They have had a profound and positive \n                impact on our country through, among other things, \n                their community's strong commitment to family, faith, \n                hard work, and service. Many Hispanics contribute to \n                this Nation bilingually in the English and Spanish \n                languages--a true asset for our country in an \n                increasingly global, interdependent world.\n\n                Hispanic students are the largest minority group in our \n                Nation's schools, numbering more than 11 million in our \n                public elementary and secondary school system, and \n                constituting more than 22 percent of all pre-K-12 \n                students. Hispanic students face educational challenges \n                of crisis proportions. Fewer than half of all Hispanic \n                children participate in early childhood education \n                programs, and far too few Hispanic students graduate \n                from high school; of those who do complete high school, \n                many are not adequately prepared for college. Only 12 \n                percent of adult Hispanics have a bachelor's degree, \n                and just 3 percent have completed graduate or \n                professional degree programs. At the same time, large \n                numbers of Hispanic adults lack the education or \n                literacy skills they need to advance their careers; \n                they also are less likely than members of other groups \n                to have taken job- or career-related courses, with the \n                exception of basic education classes, such as English \n                as a second language.\n\n                Our country was built on and continues to thrive on its \n                diversity, and there is no doubt that the future of the \n                United States is inextricably linked to the future of \n                the Hispanic community. To reach the ambitious \n                education goals we have set for our Nation, as well as \n                to ensure equality of opportunity for all, we must \n                provide the opportunities that will enable Hispanic \n                students to raise their educational attainment at every \n                level of the American education system. America's \n                future competitiveness in our global economy will be \n                substantially enhanced by improving educational \n                outcomes for Hispanics.\n\n                Sec. 2. White House Initiative on Educational \n                Excellence for Hispanics.\n\n                    (a) Establishment. There is established the White \n                House Initiative on Educational Excellence for \n                Hispanics (Initiative), to be housed in the Department \n                of Education (Department). The mission of the \n                Initiative shall be to help restore the United States \n                to its role as the global leader in education and to \n                strengthen the Nation by expanding educational \n                opportunities and improving educational outcomes for \n                Hispanics of all ages and by helping to ensure that all \n                Hispanics receive a complete and competitive education \n                that prepares them for college, a career, and \n                productive and satisfying lives.\n                    (b) Initiative Administration. There shall be an \n                Executive Director of the Initiative, to be appointed \n                by the Secretary of Education (Secretary).

For the purposes of this order:\n\n                    (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or \n                entity;\n                    (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, \n                association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, \n                subgroup, or other organization;\n                    (c) the term ``United States person'' means any \n                United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity \n                organized under the laws of the United States or any \n                jurisdiction within the United States (including \n                foreign branches), or any person in the United States; \n                and\n                    (d) the term the ``Government of the Russian \n                Federation'' means the Government of the Russian \n                Federation, any political subdivision, agency, or \n                instrumentality thereof, including the Central Bank of \n                the Russian Federation, and any person owned or \n                controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, the \n                Government of the Russian Federation.\n\n                Sec. 7.

Policy. The Federal Government benefits from \n                a diverse workforce that includes students and recent \n                graduates, who infuse the workplace with their \n                enthusiasm, talents, and unique perspectives. The \n                existing competitive hiring process for the Federal \n                civil service, however, is structured in a manner that, \n                even at the entry level, favors job applicants who have \n                significant previous work experience. This structure, \n                along with the complexity of the rules governing \n                admission to the career civil service, creates a \n                barrier to recruiting and hiring students and recent \n                graduates. It places the Federal Government at a \n                competitive disadvantage compared to private-sector \n                employers when it comes to hiring qualified applicants \n                for entry-level positions.\n\n                To compete effectively for students and recent \n                graduates, the Federal Government must improve its \n                recruiting efforts; offer clear paths to Federal \n                internships for students from high school through post-\n                graduate school; offer clear paths to civil service \n                careers for recent graduates; and provide meaningful \n                training, mentoring, and career-development \n                opportunities. Further, exposing students and recent \n                graduates to Federal jobs through internships and \n                similar programs attracts them to careers in the \n                Federal Government and enables agency employers to \n                evaluate them on the job to determine whether they are \n                likely to have successful careers in Government.\n\n                Accordingly, pursuant to my authority under 5 U.S.C. \n                3302(1), and in order to achieve a workforce that \n                represents all segments of society as provided in 5 \n                U.S.C. 2301(b)(1), I find that conditions of good \n                administration (specifically, the need to promote \n                employment opportunities for students and recent \n                graduates in the Federal workforce) make necessary an \n                exception to the competitive hiring rules for certain \n                positions in the Federal civil service.\n\n                Sec. 2. Establishment. There are hereby established the \n                Internship Program and the Recent Graduates Program, \n                which, along with the Presidential Management Fellows \n                Program, as modified herein, shall collectively be \n                known as the Pathways Programs. I therefore direct the \n                Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to \n                issue regulations implementing the Pathways Programs \n                consistent with this order, including:\n\n                    (a) a description of the positions that executive \n                departments and agencies (agencies) may fill through \n                the Pathways Programs because conditions of good \n                administration necessitate excepting those positions \n                from the competitive hiring rules;\n                    (b) rules governing whether, to what extent, and in \n                what manner public notice should be provided of job \n                opportunities in the Pathways Programs;\n                    (c) a description of career-development, training, \n                and mentorship opportunities for participants in the \n                Pathways Programs;\n                    (d) requirements that managers meaningfully assess \n                the performance of participants in the Pathways \n                Programs to identify those who should be considered for \n                conversion to career civil service positions;\n                    (e) a description of OPM oversight of agency use of \n                the Pathways Programs to ensure that (i) they serve as \n                a supplement to, and not a substitute for,\n\n[[Page 82586]]\n\n                the competitive hiring process, and (ii) agencies are \n                using the Pathways Programs in a genuine effort to \n                develop talent for careers in the civil service;\n                    (f) a description of OPM plans to evaluate \n                agencies' effectiveness in recruiting and retaining \n                talent using the Pathways Programs and of the \n                satisfaction of Pathways Programs participants and \n                their hiring managers; and\n                    (g) standard naming conventions across agencies, so \n                that students and recent graduates can clearly \n                understand and compare the career pathway opportunities \n                available to them in the Federal Government.\n\n                Sec. 3. Internship Program. The Internship Program \n                shall provide students in high schools, community \n                colleges, 4-year colleges, trade schools, career and \n                technical education programs, and other qualifying \n                educational institutions and programs, as determined by \n                OPM, with paid opportunities to work in agencies and \n                explore Federal careers while still in school. The \n                Internship Program would replace the existing Student \n                Career Experience Program, established pursuant to \n                Executive Order 12015 of October 26, 1977. The \n                following principles and policies shall govern the \n                Internship Program:\n\n                    (a) Participants in the program shall be referred \n                to as ``Interns'' and shall be students enrolled, or \n                accepted for enrollment, in qualifying educational \n                institutions and programs, as determined by OPM.\n                    (b) Subject to any exceptions OPM may establish by \n                regulation, agencies shall provide Interns with \n                meaningful developmental work and set clear \n                expectations regarding the work experience of the \n                intern.\n                    (c) Students employed by third-party internship \n                providers but placed in agencies may, to the extent \n                permitted by OPM regulations, be treated as \n                participants in the Internship Program.\n\n                Sec. 4. Recent Graduates Program. The Recent Graduates \n                Program shall provide individuals who have recently \n                graduated from qualifying educational institutions or \n                programs with developmental experiences in the Federal \n                Government intended to promote possible careers in the \n                civil service. The following principles and policies \n                shall govern the Recent Graduates Program:\n\n                    (a) Participants in the program shall be referred \n                to as ``Recent Graduates'' and must have obtained a \n                qualifying degree, or completed a qualifying career or \n                technical education program, as determined by OPM, \n                within the preceding 2 years, except that veterans who, \n                due to their military service obligation, were \n                precluded from participating in the Recent Graduates \n                Program during the 2-year period after obtaining a \n                qualifying degree or completing a qualifying program \n                shall be eligible to participate in the Program within \n                6 years of obtaining a qualifying degree or completing \n                a qualifying program.\n                    (b) Responsibilities assigned to a Recent Graduate \n                shall be consistent with his or her qualifications, \n                educational background, and career interests, the \n                purpose of the Recent Graduates Program, and agency \n                needs.\n\n                Sec. 5. Presidential Management Fellows Program. The \n                Presidential Management Fellows (PMF) Program is an \n                existing program established pursuant to Executive \n                Order 13318 of November 21, 2003, that aims to attract \n                to the Federal service outstanding men and women from a \n                variety of academic disciplines at the graduate level \n                who have a clear interest in, and commitment to, the \n                leadership and management of public policies and \n                programs.

Policy. The world must reduce greenhouse gas \n                emissions to prevent the most dangerous consequences of \n                climate change. Even with increased efforts to curb \n                these emissions, we must prepare for and adapt to the \n                impacts of climate change. The adverse impacts of \n                climate change, including sea-level rise, increases in \n                temperatures, more frequent extreme precipitation and \n                heat events, more severe droughts, and increased \n                wildfire activity, along with other impacts of \n                greenhouse gas emissions, such as ocean acidification, \n                threaten to roll back decades of progress in reducing \n                poverty and improving economic growth in vulnerable \n                countries, compromise the effectiveness and resilience \n                of U.S. development assistance, degrade security, and \n                risk intranational and international conflict over \n                resources.\n\n                Executive Order 13514 of October 5, 2009 (Federal \n                Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic \n                Performance), and Executive Order 13653 of November 1, \n                2013 (Preparing the United States for the Impacts of \n                Climate Change), established a strong foundation for \n                coordinated and consistent action to incorporate \n                climate-resilience considerations into policies and \n                procedures throughout the Federal Government. Executive \n                departments and agencies (agencies) with international \n                development programs must now build upon the recent \n                progress made pursuant to these orders by \n                systematically factoring climate-resilience \n                considerations into international development \n                strategies, planning, programming, investments, and \n                related funding decisions, including the planning for \n                and management of overseas facilities.\n\n                This order requires the integration of climate-\n                resilience considerations into all United States \n                international development work to the extent permitted \n                by law. Dedicated U.S. climate-change adaptation funds \n                are critical to managing the risks posed by climate-\n                change impacts in vulnerable countries. Coping with the \n                magnitude of the consequences of accelerating climate \n                change also requires enhanced efforts across the \n                Federal Government's broader international development \n                work. Consideration of current and future climate-\n                change impacts will improve the resilience of the \n                Federal Government's broader international development \n                programs, projects, investments, overseas facilities, \n                and related funding decisions. The United States will \n                also promote a similar approach among relevant \n                multilateral entities in which it participates.\n\n                By taking these steps and more fully considering \n                current and future climate-change impacts, the United \n                States will foster better decision-making processes and \n                risk-management approaches, ensure the effectiveness of \n                U.S. investments, and assist other countries in \n                integrating climate-resilience considerations into \n                their own development planning and implementation. \n                Collectively, these efforts will help to better \n                optimize broader international development work and \n                lead to enhanced global preparedness for and resilience \n                to climate change.\n\n[[Page 58232]]\n\n                The international climate-resilience actions required \n                by this order complement efforts by the Federal \n                Government to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at home \n                and globally. The more greenhouse gas emissions are \n                reduced, the less need there will be to adapt to the \n                impacts of a changing climate.\n\n                Sec. 2.

(a) \n                Implementation. To promote sustained focus on \n                implementation, both at agency headquarters and in the \n                field, the Working Group shall:\n\n                    (i) establish a 2-year timeline, divided into 6-\n                month intervals, to implement section 4(b)(i) of this \n                order, setting forth specific goals to be accomplished \n                and milestones to be achieved; and\n                    (ii) analyze, at least annually, the Federal \n                Government's progress in implementing this order and \n                provide recommendations for priority areas for further \n                implementation to the Council, Office of Management and \n                Budget, National Security Council, Council on \n                Environmental Quality, Office of Science and Technology \n                Policy, and other agencies, offices, and entities, as \n                appropriate.\n                    (b) Reporting.\n                    (i) Agencies with direct international development \n                programs and investments shall report on and track \n                progress in achieving the requirements identified in \n                section 2(a) of this order, including accomplished and \n                planned milestones, through the Federal Agency Planning \n                process set forth in section 5 of Executive Order \n                13653. Once the Working Group has developed metrics and \n                methodologies as required by section 4(b)(i)(G) of this \n                order, agency reporting shall include an estimation of \n                the proportion of each agency's direct international \n                development programs and investments for which climate-\n                risk assessments have been conducted, as well as an \n                estimation of the proportion of the programs and \n                investments for which climate risk was identified and \n                acted upon.\n                    (ii) Agencies that participate in multilateral \n                entities shall report on the efforts of multilateral \n                entities in integrating climate-resilient development \n                considerations into their operations through the \n                Federal Agency Planning process set forth in section 5 \n                of Executive Order 13653. Where more than one agency is \n                involved in the U.S. Government's participation in a \n                multilateral entity, the lead agency for such \n                participation shall be responsible for reporting, in \n                coordination with the other agencies involved.\n\n                Sec. 6. Climate-Change Mitigation. As agencies \n                incorporate climate-resilience considerations into \n                international development work, they shall continue \n                seeking opportunities to help international partners \n                promote sustainable low-emissions development. The \n                Federal Government has greatly increased the number and \n                variety of international development initiatives \n                focused on climate-change mitigation, including \n                programs to promote clean energy, energy efficiency, \n                and sustainable land-use and forestry practices, as \n                well as partnerships with more than two dozen countries \n                to formulate and implement sustainable low-emissions \n                development strategies. Within 1 year of the date of \n                this order, and building on the full range of efforts \n                the United States has undertaken to date, the National \n                Security Council shall convene relevant agencies and \n                entities to explore further mitigation opportunities in \n                broader U.S. international development work and develop \n                recommendations for further action.\n\n                Sec. 7.

I hereby \n                order:\n\n                Section 1. A major national security goal of the United \n                States is to ensure that fissile material removed from \n                Russian nuclear weapons pursuant to various arms \n                control and disarmament agreements is dedicated to \n                peaceful uses, subject to transparency measures, and \n                protected from diversion to activities of proliferation \n                concern. As reflected in Executive Order 13085, the \n                full implementation of the Agreement Between the \n                Government of the United States of America and the \n                Government of the Russian Federation Concerning the \n                Disposition of Highly Enriched Uranium Extracted from \n                Nuclear Weapons, dated February 18, 1993, and related \n                contracts and agreements (collectively, the ``HEU \n                Agreements'') is essential to the attainment of this \n                goal. The HEU Agreements provide for the conversion of \n                approximately 500 metric tons of highly enriched \n                uranium contained in Russian nuclear weapons into low-\n                enriched uranium for use as fuel in commercial nuclear \n                reactors. In furtherance of our national security \n                goals, all heads of departments and agencies of the \n                United States Government shall continue to take all \n                appropriate measures within their authority to further \n                the full implementation of the HEU Agreements.\n\n                Sec. 2. Government of the Russian Federation assets \n                directly related to the implementation of the HEU \n                Agreements currently may be subject to attachment, \n                judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or \n                other judicial process, thereby jeopardizing the full \n                implementation of the HEU Agreements to the detriment \n                of U.S. foreign policy. In order to ensure the \n                preservation and proper and complete transfer to the \n                Government of the Russian Federation of all payments \n                due to it under the HEU Agreements, and except to the \n                extent provided in regulations, orders, directives, or \n                licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, or \n                that were issued pursuant to Executive Order 13159 of \n                June 21, 2000, all property and interests in property \n                of the Government of the Russian Federation directly \n                related to the implementation of the HEU Agreements \n                that are in the United States, that hereafter come \n                within the United States, or that are or hereafter come \n                within the possession or control of any United States \n                persons, including any foreign branch, are blocked and \n                may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or \n                otherwise dealt in.

(a) The Secretary of the Treasury, in \n                consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary \n                of Energy, and, as appropriate, other agencies, is \n                hereby authorized to take such actions, including the \n                promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ \n                all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be \n                necessary to carry out the purposes of this order.

I \n                therefore determine that for these measures to be \n                effective in addressing the national emergency declared \n                in Executive Order 12957, there need be no prior notice \n                of an action taken pursuant to subsections 1(a)(iv), \n                2(a), 3(a), and 7(a)(iv) of this order.\n\n                Sec. 15. Executive Order 13622 is hereby amended as \n                follows:\n\n                (a) Subsection (1)(c)(ii) is amended by deleting the \n                words ``with respect to the country with primary \n                jurisdiction over the foreign financial institution.''\n\n[[Page 62145]]\n\n                (b) Subsection (2)(b)(ii) is amended by deleting the \n                words ``with respect to the country with primary \n                jurisdiction over the person.''\n\n                (c) Subsection 1(d) is amended by inserting the words \n                ``agricultural commodities,'' after the words ``sale \n                of.''\n\n                Sec. 16. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to \n                take such actions, including the promulgation of rules \n                and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to \n                the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to carry \n                out section 104A of CISADA (22 U.S.C. 8514). The \n                Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these \n                functions to other officers and agencies of the United \n                States Government consistent with applicable law.\n\n                Sec. 17. All agencies of the United States Government \n                are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures \n                within their authority to carry out the provisions of \n                this order.\n\n                Sec. 18.

The prohibitions in section 1 of this order \n                include but are not limited to:\n\n                    (a) the making of any contribution or provision of \n                funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of \n                any person whose property and interests in property are \n                blocked pursuant to this order; and\n                    (b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of \n                funds, goods, or services from any such person.\n\n                Sec. 5. (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has \n                the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation \n                of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set \n                forth in this order is prohibited.\n\n                    (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the \n                prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.\n\n                Sec. 6. For the purposes of this order:\n\n                    (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or \n                entity;\n                    (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, \n                association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, \n                subgroup, or other organization; and\n                    (c) the term ``United States person'' means any \n                United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity \n                organized under the laws of the United States or any \n                jurisdiction within the United States (including \n                foreign branches), or any person in the United States.\n\n                Sec. 7. For those persons whose property and interests \n                in property are blocked pursuant to this order who \n                might have a constitutional presence in the United \n                States, I find that because of the ability to transfer \n                funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to \n                such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this \n                order would render those measures ineffectual. I \n                therefore determine that for these measures to be \n                effective in addressing the national emergency declared \n                in this order, there need be no prior notice of a \n                listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of \n                this order.\n\n                Sec. 8. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to \n                take such actions, including the promulgation of rules \n                and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to \n                the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to carry \n                out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the \n                Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other \n                officers and agencies of the United States Government \n                consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the \n                United States Government are hereby directed to take \n                all appropriate measures within their authority to \n                carry out the provisions of this order.\n\n                Sec. 9. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to \n                submit the recurring and final reports\n\n[[Page 13495]]\n\n                to the Congress on the national emergency declared in \n                this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA \n                (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 \n                U.S.C. 1703(c)).\n\n                Sec. 10.
