Policy. This order is issued consistent with \n                the following findings and principles:\n\n                    (a) The United States is committed to community-\n                based alternatives for individuals with disabilities \n                and recognizes that such services advance the best \n                interests of Americans.\n                    (b) The United States seeks to ensure that \n                America's community-based programs effectively foster \n                independence and participation in the community for \n                Americans with disabilities.\n                    (c) Unjustified isolation or segregation of \n                qualified individuals with disabilities through \n                institutionalization is a form of disability-based \n                discrimination prohibited by Title II of the Americans \n                With Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U.S.C. 12101 \n                et. seq. States must avoid disability-based \n                discrimination unless doing so would fundamentally \n                alter the nature of the service, program, or activity \n                provided by the State.\n                    (d) In Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999) (the \n                ``Olmstead decision''), the Supreme Court construed \n                Title II of the ADA to require States to place \n                qualified individuals with mental disabilities in \n                community settings, rather than in institutions, \n                whenever treatment professionals determine that such \n                placement is appropriate, the affected persons do not \n                oppose such placement, and the State can reasonably \n                accommodate the placement, taking into account the \n                resources available to the State and the needs of \n                others with disabilities.\n                    (e) The Federal Government must assist States and \n                localities to implement swiftly the Olmstead decision, \n                so as to help ensure that all Americans have the \n                opportunity to live close to their families and \n                friends, to live more independently, to engage in \n                productive employment, and to participate in community \n                life.\n\n                Sec. 2. Swift Implementation of the Olmstead Decision: \n                Agency Responsibilities. (a) The Attorney General, the \n                Secretaries of Health and Human Services, Education, \n                Labor, and Housing and Urban Development, and the \n                Commissioner of the Social Security Administration \n                shall work cooperatively to ensure that the Olmstead \n                decision is implemented in a timely manner. \n                Specifically, the designated agencies should work with \n                States to help them assess their compliance with the \n                Olmstead decision and the ADA in providing services to \n                qualified individuals with disabilities in community-\n                based settings, as long as such services are \n                appropriate to the needs of those individuals. These \n                agencies should provide technical guidance and work \n                cooperatively with States to achieve the goals of Title \n                II of the ADA, particularly where States have chosen to \n                develop comprehensive, effectively working plans to \n                provide services to qualified individuals with \n                disabilities in the most integrated settings. These \n                agencies should also ensure that existing Federal \n                resources are used in the most effective manner to \n                support the goals of the ADA. The Secretary of Health \n                and Human Services shall take the lead in coordinating \n                these efforts.\n\n[[Page 33156]]\n\n                    (b) The Attorney General, the Secretaries of Health \n                and Human Services, Education, Labor, and Housing and \n                Urban Development, and the Commissioner of the Social \n                Security Administration shall evaluate the policies, \n                programs, statutes, and regulations of their respective \n                agencies to determine whether any should be revised or \n                modified to improve the availability of community-based \n                services for qualified individuals with disabilities. \n                The review shall focus on identifying affected \n                populations, improving the flow of information about \n                supports in the community, and removing barriers that \n                impede opportunities for community placement. The \n                review should ensure the involvement of consumers, \n                advocacy organizations, providers, and relevant agency \n                representatives. Each agency head should report to the \n                President, through the Secretary of Health and Human \n                Services, with the results of their evaluation within \n                120 days.\n                    (c) The Attorney General and the Secretary of \n                Health and Human Services shall fully enforce Title II \n                of the ADA, including investigating and resolving \n                complaints filed on behalf of individuals who allege \n                that they have been the victims of unjustified \n                institutionalization. Whenever possible, the Department \n                of Justice and the Department of Health and Human \n                Services should work cooperatively with States to \n                resolve these complaints, and should use alternative \n                dispute resolution to bring these complaints to a quick \n                and constructive resolution.\n                    (d) The agency actions directed by this order shall \n                be done consistent with this Administration's budget.\n\n                Sec. 3. Judicial Review. Nothing in this order shall \n                affect any otherwise available judicial review of \n                agency action. This order is intended only to improve \n                the internal management of the Federal Government and \n                does not create any right or benefit, substantive or \n                procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party \n                against the United States, its agencies or \n                instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any \n                other person.\n\n                    (Presidential Sig.)B\n\n                THE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n                    June 18, 2001.\n\n[FR Doc. 01-15758\nFiled 6-20-01; 8:45 am]\nBilling code 3195-01-P\n\n\n</pre>]","url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2001/06/21/01-15758/community-based-alternatives-for-individuals-with","president":"bush","id":"13217"},"reftime":1418257614413}

Nondiscrimination in Federal Employment on \n                the Basis of Protected Genetic Information.\n\n                    1-101. It is the policy of the Government of the \n                United States to provide equal employment opportunity \n                in Federal employment for all qualified persons and to \n                prohibit discrimination against employees based on \n                protected genetic information, or information about a \n                request for or the receipt of genetic services. This \n                policy of equal opportunity applies to every aspect of \n                Federal employment.\n                    1-102. The head of each Executive department and \n                agency shall extend the policy set forth in section 1-\n                101 to all its employees covered by section 717 of \n                Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended \n                (42 U.S.C. 2000e-16).\n                    1-103.

All women \n                are at risk for breast cancer, including those with no \n                family history of the disease. This year alone, 182,000 \n                women are expected to be diagnosed with breast cancer; \n                46,000 will die. The risk of death is reduced \n                significantly if the cancer can be found in the \n                earlier, more treatable stages. With appropriate breast \n                cancer screening and state-of-the-art care, experts \n                expect to see a 30 percent drop in the death rate. \n                Together, we must work to make sure that every woman is \n                informed about breast cancer and about the importance \n                of regular examinations, including high-quality \n                screening mammography. And we must ensure that all \n                women have access to this invaluable preventive care.\n\n                Today, mammography is considered the most effective \n                method for detecting early stage breast cancer. Many \n                cancers can be seen on a mammogram as soon as 2 years \n                before they could be detected by a woman or her \n                physician. But only half of all women ages 50 and older \n                have had a mammogram in the past 2 years, and as few as \n                30 percent have mammograms routinely. African American \n                women experience a higher death rate from breast cancer \n                than white women, and recently we learned that this is \n                primarily because they are diagnosed at more advanced \n                stages of the disease. Researchers have concluded that \n                if we are to improve the survival rate of African \n                American women, we must develop strategies aimed at \n                increasing their use of and access to early detection \n                techniques such as mammography.\n\n                We can all be encouraged by the progress in improving \n                and monitoring mammography. As of October 2, 1994, \n                provisions of the Mammography Quality Standards Act of \n                1992, requiring national, uniform quality and safety \n                standards, went into effect. Mammography facilities \n                must now meet stringent requirements and be certified \n                to ensure they are providing high-quality service. In \n                addition, scientists currently are working to apply \n                American know-how to improve mammography and to develop \n                high-technology imaging methods to detect breast \n                tumors. Digital mammography, for example, may enhance \n                the quality of mammographic images and even magnify the \n                view of specific areas of the breast. Scientists also \n                are exploring such technologies as magnetic resonance \n                imaging (MRI) and ultrasound imaging for this purpose.\n\n                In recognition of the crucial role mammography plays in \n                the battle against breast cancer, the Congress, by \n                Senate Joint Resolution 220, has designated October 19, \n                1994, as ``National Mammography Day'' and has \n                authorized and requested the President to issue a \n                proclamation in observance of this day.\n\n                NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the \n                United States of America, do hereby proclaim October \n                19, 1994, as National Mammography Day. I invite the \n                Governors of the 50 States and the Commonwealth of \n                Puerto Rico, the Mayor of the District of Columbia, and \n                the appropriate officials of all other areas under the \n                American flag to issue similar proclamations.

Policy. The United States is committed to a \n                policy of careful assessment and consideration of the \n                environmental impacts of trade agreements. The United \n                States will factor environmental considerations into \n                the development of its trade negotiating objectives. \n                Responsible agencies will accomplish these goals \n                through a process of ongoing assessment and evaluation, \n                and, in certain instances, written environmental \n                reviews.\n\n                Sec. 2. Purpose and Need. Trade agreements should \n                contribute to the broader goal of sustainable \n                development. Environmental reviews are an important \n                tool to help identify potential environmental effects \n                of trade agreements, both positive and negative, and to \n                help facilitate consideration of appropriate responses \n                to those effects whether in the course of negotiations, \n                through other means, or both.\n\n                Sec. 3. (a) Implementation. The United States Trade \n                Representative (Trade Representative) and the Chair of \n                the Council on Environmental Quality shall oversee the \n                implementation of this order, including the development \n                of procedures pursuant to this order, in consultation \n                with appropriate foreign policy, environmental, and \n                economic agencies.\n\n                    (b) Conduct of Environmental Reviews. The Trade \n                Representative, through the interagency Trade Policy \n                Staff Committee (TPSC), shall conduct the environmental \n                reviews of the agreements under section 4 of this \n                order.\n\n                Sec. 4.

These \n                include:\n                    (i) comprehensive multilateral trade rounds;\n                    (ii) bilateral or plurilateral free trade \n                agreements; and\n                    (iii) major new trade liberalization agreements in \n                natural resource sectors.\n                    (b) Agreements reached in connection with \n                enforcement and dispute resolution actions are not \n                covered by this order.\n                    (c) For trade agreements not covered under \n                subsections 4(a) and (b), environmental reviews will \n                generally not be required. Most sectoral liberalization \n                agreements will not require an environmental review. \n                The Trade Representative, through the TPSC, shall \n                determine whether an environmental review of an \n                agreement or category of agreements is warranted based \n                on such factors as the significance of reasonably \n                foreseeable environmental impacts.\n\n                Sec. 5. Environmental Reviews.\n\n                    (a) Environmental reviews shall be:\n                    (i) written;\n                    (ii) initiated through a Federal Register notice, \n                outlining the proposed agreement and soliciting public \n                comment and information on the scope of the \n                environmental review of the agreement;\n\n[[Page 63170]]\n\n                    (iii) undertaken sufficiently early in the process \n                to inform the development of negotiating positions, but \n                shall not be a condition for the timely tabling of \n                particular negotiating proposals;\n                    (iv) made available in draft form for public \n                comment, where practicable; and\n                    (v) made available to the public in final form.\n                    (b) As a general matter, the focus of environmental \n                reviews will be impacts in the United States. As \n                appropriate and prudent, reviews may also examine \n                global and transboundary impacts.\n\n                Sec. 6. Resources.

Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. 425 \n                (1977), and other cases, it is hereby ordered as \n                follows:\n\n                Section 1. Definitions.\n\n                    For purposes of this order:\n                    (a) ``Archivist'' refers to the Archivist of the \n                United States or his designee.\n                    (b) ``Presidential records'' refers to those \n                documentary materials maintained by the National \n                Archives and Records Administration pursuant to the \n                Presidential Records Act, 44 U.S.C. 2201-2207.\n                    (c) ``Former President'' refers to the former \n                President during whose term or terms of office \n                particular Presidential records were created.\n\n                Sec. 2. Constitutional and Legal Background.\n\n                (a) For a period not to exceed 12 years after the \n                conclusion of a Presidency, the Archivist administers \n                records in accordance with the limitations on access \n                imposed by section 2204 of title 44. After expiration \n                of that period, section 2204(c) of title 44 directs \n                that the Archivist administer Presidential records in \n                accordance with section 552 of title 5, the Freedom of \n                Information Act, including by withholding, as \n                appropriate, records subject to exemptions (b)(1), \n                (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(6), (b)(7), (b)(8), and \n                (b)(9) of section 552. Section 2204(c)(1) of title 44 \n                provides that exemption (b)(5) of section 552 is not \n                available to the Archivist as a basis for withholding \n                records, but section 2204(c)(2) recognizes that the \n                former President or the incumbent President may assert \n                any constitutionally based privileges, including those \n                ordinarily encompassed within exemption (b)(5) of \n                section 552. The President's constitutionally based \n                privileges subsume privileges for records that reflect: \n                military, diplomatic, or national security secrets (the \n                state secrets privilege); communications of the \n                President or his advisors (the presidential \n                communications privilege); legal advice or legal work \n                (the attorney-client or attorney work product \n                privileges); and the deliberative processes of the \n                President or his advisors (the deliberative process \n                privilege).\n\n                (b) In Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, the \n                Supreme Court set forth the constitutional basis for \n                the President's privileges for confidential \n                communications: ``Unless [the President] can give his \n                advisers some assurance of confidentiality, a President \n                could not expect to receive the full and frank \n                submissions of facts and opinions upon which effective \n                discharge of his duties depends.'' 433 U.S. at 448-49. \n                The Court cited the precedent of the Constitutional \n                Convention, the records of which were ``sealed for more \n                than 30 years after the Convention.'' Id. at 447 n.11. \n                Based on those precedents and principles, the Court \n                ruled that constitutionally based privileges available \n                to a President ``survive[] the individual President's \n                tenure.''Id. at 449. The Court also held that a former \n                President, although no longer\n\n[[Page 56026]]\n\n                a Government official, may assert constitutionally \n                based privileges with respect to his Administration's \n                Presidential records, and expressly rejected the \n                argument that ``only an incumbent President can assert \n                the privilege of the Presidency.'' Id. at 448.\n\n                (c) The Supreme Court has held that a party seeking to \n                overcome the constitutionally based privileges that \n                apply to Presidential records must establish at least a \n                ``demonstrated, specific need'' for particular records, \n                a standard that turns on the nature of the proceeding \n                and the importance of the information to that \n                proceeding. See United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, \n                713 (1974). Notwithstanding the constitutionally based \n                privileges that apply to Presidential records, many \n                former Presidents have authorized access, after what \n                they considered an appropriate period of repose, to \n                those records or categories of records (including \n                otherwise privileged records) to which the former \n                Presidents or their representatives in their discretion \n                decided to authorize access. See Nixon v. Administrator \n                of General Services, 433 U.S. at 450-51.\n\n                Sec. 3. Procedure for Administering Privileged \n                Presidential Records.\n\n                Consistent with the requirements of the Constitution \n                and the Presidential Records Act, the Archivist shall \n                administer Presidential records under section 2204(c) \n                of title 44 in the following manner:\n\n                (a) At an appropriate time after the Archivist receives \n                a request for access to Presidential records under \n                section 2204(c)(1), the Archivist shall provide notice \n                to the former President and the incumbent President \n                and, as soon as practicable, shall provide the former \n                President and the incumbent President copies of any \n                records that the former President and the incumbent \n                President request to review.\n\n                (b) After receiving the records he requests, the former \n                President shall review those records as expeditiously \n                as possible, and for no longer than 90 days for \n                requests that are not unduly burdensome. The Archivist \n                shall not permit access to the records by a requester \n                during this period of review or when requested by the \n                former President to extend the time for review.\n\n                (c) After review of the records in question, or of any \n                other potentially privileged records reviewed by the \n                former President, the former President shall indicate \n                to the Archivist whether the former President requests \n                withholding of or authorizes access to any privileged \n                records.\n\n                (d) Concurrent with or after the former President's \n                review of the records, the incumbent President or his \n                designee may also review the records in question, or \n                may utilize whatever other procedures the incumbent \n                President deems appropriate to decide whether to concur \n                in the former President's decision to request \n                withholding of or authorize access to the records.\n\n                (1) When the former President has requested withholding \n                of the records:\n\n(i)\n\n If under the standard set forth in section 4 below, the incumbent \nPresident concurs in the former President's decision to request withholding \nof records as privileged, the incumbent President shall so inform the \nformer President and the Archivist. The Archivist shall not permit access \nto those records by a requester unless and until the incumbent President \nadvises the Archivist that the former President and the incumbent President \nagree to authorize access to the records or until so ordered by a final and \nnonappealable court order.\n\n[[Page 56027]]\n\n(ii)\n\n If under the standard set forth in section 4 below, the incumbent \nPresident does not concur in the former President's decision to request \nwithholding of the records as privileged, the incumbent President shall so \ninform the former President and the Archivist. Because the former President \nindependently retains the right to assert constitutionally based \nprivileges, the Archivist shall not permit access to the records by a \nrequester unless and until the incumbent President advises the Archivist \nthat the former President and the incumbent President agree to authorize \naccess to the records or until so ordered by a final and nonappealable \ncourt order.\n\n                (2) When the former President has authorized access to \n                the records:\n\n(i)\n\n If under the standard set forth in section 4 below, the incumbent \nPresident concurs in the former President's decision to authorize access to \nthe records, the Archivist shall permit access to the records by the \nrequester.\n\n(ii)\n\n If under the standard set forth in section 4 below, the incumbent \nPresident does not concur in the former President's decision to authorize \naccess to the records, the incumbent President may independently order the \nArchivist to withhold privileged records. In that instance, the Archivist \nshall not permit access to the records by a requester unless and until the \nincumbent President advises the Archivist that the former President and the \nincumbent President agree to authorize access to the records or until so \nordered by a final and nonappealable court order.\n\n                Sec. 4. Concurrence by Incumbent President.\n\n                Absent compelling circumstances, the incumbent \n                President will concur in the privilege decision of the \n                former President in response to a request for access \n                under section 2204(c)(1). When the incumbent President \n                concurs in the decision of the former President to \n                request withholding of records within the scope of a \n                constitutionally based privilege, the incumbent \n                President will support that privilege claim in any \n                forum in which the privilege claim is challenged.\n\n                Sec. 5. Incumbent President's Right to Obtain Access.\n\n                This order does not expand or limit the incumbent \n                President's right to obtain access to the records of a \n                former President pursuant to section 2205(2)(B).\n\n                Sec. 6. Right of Congress and Courts to Obtain Access.\n\n                This order does not expand or limit the rights of a \n                court, House of Congress, or authorized committee or \n                subcommittee of Congress to obtain access to the \n                records of a former President pursuant to section \n                2205(2)(A) or section 2205(2)(C). With respect to such \n                requests, the former President shall review the records \n                in question and, within 21 days of receiving notice \n                from the Archivist, indicate to the Archivist his \n                decision with respect to any privilege. The incumbent \n                President shall indicate his decision with respect to \n                any privilege within 21 days after the former President \n                has indicated his decision. Those periods may be \n                extended by the former President or the incumbent \n                President for requests that are burdensome. The \n                Archivist shall not permit access to the records unless \n                and until the incumbent President advises the Archivist \n                that the former President and the incumbent President \n                agree to authorize access to the records or until so \n                ordered by a final and nonappealable court order.\n\n                Sec. 7. No Effect on Right to Withhold Records.\n\n                This order does not limit the former President's or the \n                incumbent President's right to withhold records on any \n                ground supplied by the Constitution, statute, or \n                regulation.\n\n                Sec. 8. Withholding of Privileged Records During 12-\n                Year Period.\n\n[[Page 56028]]\n\n                In the period not to exceed 12 years after the \n                conclusion of a Presidency during which section 2204(a) \n                and section 2204(b) of title 44 apply, a former \n                President or the incumbent President may request \n                withholding of any privileged records not already \n                protected from disclosure under section 2204. If the \n                former President or the incumbent President so \n                requests, the Archivist shall not permit access to any \n                such privileged records unless and until the incumbent \n                President advises the Archivist that the former \n                President and the incumbent President agree to \n                authorize access to the records or until so ordered by \n                a final and nonappealable court order.\n\n                Sec. 9. Establishment of Procedures.\n\n                This order is not intended to indicate whether and \n                under what circumstances a former President should \n                assert or waive any privilege. The order is intended to \n                establish procedures for former and incumbent \n                Presidents to make privilege determinations.\n\n                Sec. 10. Designation of Representative.\n\n                The former President may designate a representative (or \n                series or group of alternative representatives, as the \n                former President in his discretion may determine) to \n                act on his behalf for purposes of the Presidential \n                Records Act and this order. Upon the death or \n                disability of a former President, the former \n                President's designated representative shall act on his \n                behalf for purposes of the Act and this order, \n                including with respect to the assertion of \n                constitutionally based privileges. In the absence of \n                any designated representative after the former \n                President's death or disability, the family of the \n                former President may designate a representative (or \n                series or group of alternative representatives, as they \n                in their discre tion may determine) to act on the \n                former President's behalf for purposes of the Act and \n                this order, including with respect to the assertion of \n                constitutionally based privileges.\n\n                Sec. 11. Vice Presidential Records.\n\n                (a) Pursuant to section 2207 of title 44 of the United \n                States Code, the Presidential Records Act applies to \n                the executive records of the Vice President. Subject to \n                subsections (b) and (c), this order shall also apply \n                with respect to any such records that are subject to \n                any constitutionally based privilege that the former \n                Vice President may be entitled to invoke, but in the \n                administration of this order with respect to such \n                records, references in this order to a former President \n                shall be deemed also to be references to the relevant \n                former Vice President.\n\n                (b) Subsection (a) shall not be deemed to authorize a \n                Vice President or former Vice President to invoke any \n                constitutional privilege of a President or former \n                President except as authorized by that President or \n                former President.\n\n                (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to \n                grant, limit, or otherwise affect any privilege of a \n                President, Vice President, former President, or former \n                Vice President.\n\n                Sec. 12. Judicial Review.\n\n                This order is intended to improve the internal \n                management of the executive branch and is not intended \n                to create any right or benefit, substantive or \n                procedural, enforceable at law by a party, other than a \n                former President or his designated representative, \n                against the United States, its agencies, its officers, \n                or any person.\n\n[[Page 56029]]\n\n                Sec. 13.

Policy. (a) In administering sections 301-\n                310 of the Trade Act of 1974, the United States shall \n                not seek, through negotiation or otherwise, the \n                revocation or revision of any intellectual property law \n                or policy of a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country, \n                as determined by the President, that regulates HIV/AIDS \n                pharmaceuticals or medical technologies if the law or \n                policy of the country:\n\n                    (1) promotes access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals or \n                medical technologies for affected populations in that \n                country; and\n                    (2) provides adequate and effective intellectual \n                property protection consistent with the Agreement on \n                Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights \n                (TRIPS Agreement) referred to in section 101(d)(15) of \n                the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. \n                3511(d)(15)).\n                    (b) The United States shall encourage all \n                beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries to implement \n                policies designed to address the underlying causes of \n                the HIV/AIDS crisis by, among other things, making \n                efforts to encourage practices that will prevent \n                further transmission and infection and to stimulate \n                development of the infrastructure necessary to deliver \n                adequate health services, and by encouraging policies \n                that provide an incentive for public and private \n                research on, and development of, vaccines and other \n                medical innovations that will combat the HIV/AIDS \n                epidemic in Africa.\n\n                Sec. 2. Rationale: (a) This order finds that:\n\n                    (1) since the onset of the worldwide HIV/AIDS \n                epidemic, approximately 34 million people living in \n                sub-Saharan Africa have been infected with the disease;\n                    (2) of those infected, approximately 11.5 million \n                have died;\n                    (3) the deaths represent 83 percent of the total \n                HIV/AIDS-related deaths worldwide; and\n                    (4) access to effective therapeutics for HIV/AIDS \n                is determined by issues of price, health system \n                infrastructure for delivery, and sustainable financing.\n                    (b) In light of these findings, this order \n                recognizes that:\n                    (1) it is in the interest of the United States to \n                take all reasonable steps to prevent further spread of \n                infectious disease, particularly HIV/AIDS;\n                    (2) there is critical need for effective incentives \n                to develop new pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and therapies \n                to combat the HIV/AIDS crisis, including effective \n                global intellectual property standards designed to \n                foster pharmaceutical and medical innovation;\n                    (3) the overriding priority for responding to the \n                crisis of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa should be to \n                improve public education and to encourage\n\n[[Page 30522]]\n\n                practices that will prevent further transmission and \n                infection, and to stimulate development of the \n                infrastructure necessary to deliver adequate health \n                care services;\n                    (4) the United States should work with individual \n                countries in sub-Saharan Africa to assist them in \n                development of effective public education campaigns \n                aimed at the prevention of HIV/AIDS transmission and \n                infection, and to improve their health care \n                infrastructure to promote improved access to quality \n                health care for their citizens in general, and \n                particularly with respect to the HIV/AIDS epidemic;\n                    (5) an effective United States response to the \n                crisis in sub-Saharan Africa must focus in the short \n                term on preventive programs designed to reduce the \n                frequency of new infections and remove the stigma of \n                the disease, and should place a priority on basic \n                health services that can be used to treat opportunistic \n                infections, sexually transmitted infections, and \n                complications associated with HIV/AIDS so as to prolong \n                the duration and improve the quality of life of those \n                with the disease;\n                    (6) an effective United States response to the \n                crisis must also focus on the development of HIV/AIDS \n                vaccines to prevent the spread of the disease;\n                    (7) the innovative capacity of the United States in \n                the commercial and public pharmaceutical research \n                sectors is unmatched in the world, and the \n                participation of both these sectors will be a critical \n                element in any successful program to respond to the \n                HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa;\n                    (8) the TRIPS Agreement recognizes the importance \n                of promoting effective and adequate protection of \n                intellectual property rights and the right of countries \n                to adopt measures necessary to protect public health;\n                    (9) individual countries should have the ability to \n                take measures to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic, \n                provided that such measures are consistent with their \n                international obligations; and\n                    (10) successful initiatives will require effective \n                partnerships and cooperation among governments, \n                international organizations, nongovernmental \n                organizations, and the private sector, and greater \n                consideration should be given to financial, legal, and \n                other incentives that will promote improved prevention \n                and treatment actions.\n\n                Sec. 3. Scope. (a) This order prohibits the United \n                States Government from taking action pursuant to \n                section 301(b) of the Trade Act of 1974 with respect to \n                any law or policy in beneficiary sub-Saharan African \n                countries that promotes access to HIV/AIDS \n                pharmaceuticals or medical technologies and that \n                provides adequate and effective intellectual property \n                protection consistent with the TRIPS Agreement. \n                However, this order does not prohibit United States \n                Government officials from evaluating, determining, or \n                expressing concern about whether such a law or policy \n                promotes access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals or medical \n                technologies or provides adequate and effective \n                intellectual property protection consistent with the \n                TRIPS Agreement.

There is hereby constituted the Federal \n                Career Intern Program (Program). The purpose of the \n                Program is to attract exceptional men and women to the \n                Federal workforce who have diverse professional \n                experiences, academic training, and competencies, and \n                to prepare them for careers in analyzing and \n                implementing public programs. ``Career Intern'' is a \n                generic term, and agencies may use occupational titles \n                as appropriate.\n\n                Sec. 2. The Program is another step in the \n                Administration's effort to recruit the highest caliber \n                people to the Federal Government, develop their \n                professional abilities, and retain them in Federal \n                departments and agencies. Cabinet secretaries and \n                agency administrators should view the Program as \n                complementary to existing programs that provide career \n                enhancement opportunities for Federal employees, and \n                departments and agencies are encouraged to identify and \n                make use of those programs, as well as the new Program, \n                to meet department and agency needs.\n\n                Sec. 3. (a) The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \n                shall develop appropriate merit-based procedures for \n                the recruitment, screening, placement, and continuing \n                career development of Career Interns.\n\n                    (b) In developing those procedures, the OPM shall \n                provide for such actions as deemed appropriate to \n                assure equal employment opportunity and the application \n                of appropriate veterans' preference criteria.\n\n                Sec. 4. (a) A successful candidate shall be appointed \n                to a position in Schedule B of the excepted service at \n                the GS-5, 7, or 9 (and equivalent) or other trainee \n                level appropriate for the Program, unless otherwise \n                approved by the OPM. The appointment shall not exceed 2 \n                years unless extended by the Federal department or \n                agency, with the concurrence of the OPM, for up to 1 \n                additional year.\n\n                    (b) Tenure for a Career Intern shall be governed by \n                the following principles and policies:\n\n(1)\n\nAssigned responsibilities shall be consistent with a Career Intern's \ncompetencies and career interests, and the purposes of the Program.\n\n(2)\n\nContinuation in the Program shall be contingent upon satisfactory \nperformance by the Career Intern throughout the internship period.\n\n(3)\n\nExcept as provided in subsections (4) and (5) of this section, service as a \nCareer Intern confers no rights to further Federal employment in either the \ncompetitive or excepted service upon the expiration of the internship \nperiod.\n\n(4)\n\nCompetitive civil service status may be granted to a Career Intern who \nsatisfactorily completes the internship and meets all other requirements \nprescribed by the OPM.\n\n[[Page 43212]]\n\n(5)\n\nWithin an agency, an employee who formerly held a career or career-\nconditional appointment immediately before entering the Career Intern \nProgram, and who fails to complete the Career Intern Program for reasons \nunrelated to misconduct or suitability, shall be placed in a career or \ncareer-conditional position in the current agency at no lower grade or pay \nthan the one the employee left to accept the position in the Career Intern \nProgram.\n\n                Sec. 5. A Career Intern shall participate in a formal \n                program of training and job assignments to develop \n                competencies that the OPM identifies as core to the \n                Program, and the employing agency identifies as \n                appropriate to the agency's mission and needs.\n\n                Sec. 6. The OPM shall prescribe such regulations as it \n                determines necessary to carry out the purpose of this \n                order.\n\n                Sec. 7.

This order is intended only to \n                improve the internal management of the executive \n                branch.

Policy. It is the policy of the executive \n                branch of the Government of the United States of \n                America to help answer the questions that the people of \n                Puerto Rico have asked for years regarding the options \n                for the islands' future status and the process for \n                realizing an option. Further, it is our policy to \n                consider and develop positions on proposals, without \n                preference among the options, for the Commonwealth's \n                future status; to discuss such proposals with \n                representatives of the people of Puerto Rico and the \n                Congress; to work with leaders of the Commonwealth and \n                the Congress to clarify the options to enable Puerto \n                Ricans to determine their preference among options for \n                the islands' future status that are not incompatible \n                with the Constitution and basic laws and policies of \n                the United States; and to implement such an option if \n                chosen by a majority, including helping Puerto Ricans \n                obtain a governing arrangement under which they would \n                vote for national government officials, if they choose \n                such a status.\n\n                Sec. 2. The President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's \n                Status. There is established a task force to be known \n                as ``The President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's \n                Status'' (Task Force).

Policy. (a) It is the policy of this \n                Administration to use information technology more \n                effectively to coordinate the Federal Government's \n                collection and dissemination of information to \n                appropriate response agencies and State governments to \n                prepare for and respond to natural and man-made \n                disasters (disasters). As a result of changing \n                population demographics in our coastal, rural, and \n                urban areas over the past decades, the loss of life and \n                property (losses) from disasters has nearly doubled. \n                One of the ways the Federal Government can reduce these \n                losses is to use technology more effectively to \n                coordinate its collection and dissemination (hereafter \n                referred to collectively as ``provision'') of \n                information which can be used in both planning for and \n                recovering from disasters. While many agencies provide \n                disaster-related information, they may not always \n                provide it in a coordinated manner. To improve the \n                provision of disaster-related information, the agencies \n                shall, as set out in this order, use information \n                technology to coordinate the Federal Government's \n                provision of information to prepare for, respond to, \n                and recover from domestic disasters.\n\n                    (b) It is also the policy of this Administration to \n                use information technology and existing channels of \n                disaster assistance to improve the Federal Government's \n                provision of information that could be helpful to \n                foreign governments preparing for or responding to \n                foreign disasters. Currently, the United States \n                Government provides disaster-related information to \n                foreign governments and relief organizations on \n                humanitarian grounds at the request of foreign \n                governments and where appropriate. This information is \n                supplied by Federal agencies on an ad hoc basis. To \n                increase the effectiveness of our response to foreign \n                disasters, agencies shall, where appropriate, use \n                information technology to coordinate the Federal \n                Government's provision of disaster-related information \n                to foreign governments.\n                    (c) To carry out the policies in this order, there \n                is established the Global Disaster Information Network \n                (Network). The Network is defined as the coordinated \n                effort by Federal agencies to develop a strategy and to \n                use existing technical infrastructure, to the extent \n                permitted by law and subject to the availability of \n                appropriations and under the guidance of the \n                Interagency Coordinating Committee and the Committee \n                Support Office, to make more effective use of \n                information technology to assist our Government, and \n                foreign governments where appropriate, by providing \n                disaster-related information to prepare for and respond \n                to disasters.\n\n                Sec. 2. Establishment. (a) There is established an \n                Interagency Coordinating Committee (Committee) to \n                provide leadership and oversight for the development of \n                the Network. The Office of the Vice President, the \n                Department of Commerce through the National Oceanic and \n                Atmospheric Administration, and the Department of \n                State, respectively, shall designate a representative \n                to serve as Co-chairpersons of the Committee. The \n                Committee membership shall comprise representatives \n                from the following departments and agencies:\n\n[[Page 25620]]\n\n                    (1) Department of State;\n                    (2) Department of Defense;\n                    (3) Department of the Interior;\n                    (4) Department of Agriculture;\n                    (5) Department of Commerce;\n                    (6) Department of Transportation;\n                    (7) Department of Energy;\n                    (8) Office of Management and Budget;\n                    (9) Environmental Protection Agency;\n                    (10) National Aeronautics and Space Administration;\n                    (11) United States Agency for International \n                Development;\n                    (12) Federal Emergency Management Agency; and\n                    (13) Central Intelligence Agency.\n\n                At the discretion of the Co-chairpersons of the \n                Committee, other agencies may be added to the Committee \n                membership. The Committee shall include an Executive \n                Secretary to effect coordination between the Co-\n                chairpersons of the Committee and the Committee Support \n                Office.\n\n                    (b) There is established a Committee Support Office \n                (Support Office) to assist the Committee by developing \n                plans and projects that would further the creation of \n                the Network. The Support Office shall, at the request \n                of the Co-chairpersons of the Committee, carry out \n                tasks taken on by the Committee.\n                    (c) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n                Administration shall provide funding and administrative \n                support for the Committee and the Support Office.

Action Plans. If a Federal agency fails to meet \n                its annual goals in expanding contract opportunities \n                for WOSBs, it shall work with the SBA to develop an \n                action plan to increase the likelihood that \n                participation goals will be met or exceeded in future \n                years.\n\n                Sec. 7.

Definitions. For purposes of this order:\n\n                    (a) ``Policies that have tribal implications'' \n                refers to regulations, legislative comments or proposed \n                legislation, and other policy statements or actions \n                that have substantial direct effects on one or more \n                Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal \n                Government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of \n                power and responsibilities between the Federal \n                Government and Indian tribes.\n                    (b) ``Indian tribe'' means an Indian or Alaska \n                Native tribe, band, nation, pueblo, village, or \n                community that the Secretary of the Interior \n                acknowledges to exist as an Indian tribe pursuant to \n                the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994, \n                25 U.S.C. 479a.\n                    (c) ``Agency'' means any authority of the United \n                States that is an ``agency'' under 44 U.S.C. 3502(1), \n                other than those considered to be independent \n                regulatory agencies, as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(5).\n                    (d) ``Tribal officials'' means elected or duly \n                appointed officials of Indian tribal governments or \n                authorized intertribal organizations.\n\n                Sec. 2. Fundamental Principles. In formulating or \n                implementing policies that have tribal implications, \n                agencies shall be guided by the following fundamental \n                principles:\n\n                    (a) The United States has a unique legal \n                relationship with Indian tribal governments as set \n                forth in the Constitution of the United States, \n                treaties, statutes, Executive Orders, and court \n                decisions. Since the formation of the Union, the United \n                States has recognized Indian tribes as domestic \n                dependent nations under its protection. The Federal \n                Government has enacted numerous statutes and \n                promulgated numerous regulations that establish and \n                define a trust relationship with Indian tribes.\n                    (b) Our Nation, under the law of the United States, \n                in accordance with treaties, statutes, Executive \n                Orders, and judicial decisions, has recognized the \n                right of Indian tribes to self-government. As domestic \n                dependent nations, Indian tribes exercise inherent \n                sovereign powers over their members and territory. The \n                United States continues to work with Indian tribes on a \n                government-to-government basis to address issues \n                concerning Indian tribal self-government, tribal trust \n                resources, and Indian tribal treaty and other rights.\n                    (c) The United States recognizes the right of \n                Indian tribes to self-government and supports tribal \n                sovereignty and self-determination.\n\n                Sec. 3. Policymaking Criteria. In addition to adhering \n                to the fundamental principles set forth in section 2, \n                agencies shall adhere, to the extent permitted by law, \n                to the following criteria when formulating and \n                implementing policies that have tribal implications:\n\n[[Page 67250]]\n\n                    (a) Agencies shall respect Indian tribal self-\n                government and sovereignty, honor tribal treaty and \n                other rights, and strive to meet the responsibilities \n                that arise from the unique legal relationship between \n                the Federal Government and Indian tribal governments.\n                    (b) With respect to Federal statutes and \n                regulations administered by Indian tribal governments, \n                the Federal Government shall grant Indian tribal \n                governments the maximum administrative discretion \n                possible.\n                    (c) When undertaking to formulate and implement \n                policies that have tribal implications, agencies shall:\n                    (1) encourage Indian tribes to develop their own \n                policies to achieve program objectives;\n                    (2) where possible, defer to Indian tribes to \n                establish standards; and\n                    (3) in determining whether to establish Federal \n                standards, consult with tribal officials as to the need \n                for Federal standards and any alternatives that would \n                limit the scope of Federal standards or otherwise \n                preserve the prerogatives and authority of Indian \n                tribes.\n\n                Sec. 4. Special Requirements for Legislative Proposals. \n                Agencies shall not submit to the Congress legislation \n                that would be inconsistent with the policymaking \n                criteria in Section 3.\n\n                Sec. 5. Consultation. (a) Each agency shall have an \n                accountable process to ensure meaningful and timely \n                input by tribal officials in the development of \n                regulatory policies that have tribal implications. \n                Within 30 days after the effective date of this order, \n                the head of each agency shall designate an official \n                with principal responsibility for the agency's \n                implementation of this order. Within 60 days of the \n                effective date of this order, the designated official \n                shall submit to the Office of Management and Budget \n                (OMB) a description of the agency's consultation \n                process.\n\n                    (b) To the extent practicable and permitted by law, \n                no agency shall promulgate any regulation that has \n                tribal implications, that imposes substantial direct \n                compliance costs on Indian tribal governments, and that \n                is not required by statute, unless:\n                    (1) funds necessary to pay the direct costs \n                incurred by the Indian tribal government or the tribe \n                in complying with the regulation are provided by the \n                Federal Government; or\n                    (2) the agency, prior to the formal promulgation of \n                the regulation,\n\n                 (A) consulted with tribal officials early in the \n                process of developing the proposed regulation;\n\n                 (B) in a separately identified portion of the preamble \n                to the regulation as it is to be issued in the Federal \n                Register, provides to the Director of OMB a tribal \n                summary impact statement, which consists of a \n                description of the extent of the agency's prior \n                consultation with tribal officials, a summary of the \n                nature of their concerns and the agency's position \n                supporting the need to issue the regulation, and a \n                statement of the extent to which the concerns of tribal \n                officials have been met; and\n\n                 (C) makes available to the Director of OMB any written \n                communications submitted to the agency by tribal \n                officials.\n\n                    (c) To the extent practicable and permitted by law, \n                no agency shall promulgate any regulation that has \n                tribal implications and that preempts tribal law unless \n                the agency, prior to the formal promulgation of the \n                regulation,\n                    (1) consulted with tribal officials early in the \n                process of developing the proposed regulation;\n                    (2) in a separately identified portion of the \n                preamble to the regulation as it is to be issued in the \n                Federal Register, provides to the Director of OMB a \n                tribal summary impact statement, which consists of a \n                description of the extent of the agency's prior \n                consultation with tribal officials, a summary of the \n                nature of their concerns and the agency's position \n                supporting the\n\n[[Page 67251]]\n\n                need to issue the regulation, and a statement of the \n                extent to which the concerns of tribal officials have \n                been met; and\n                    (3) makes available to the Director of OMB any \n                written communications submitted to the agency by \n                tribal officials.\n                    (d) On issues relating to tribal self-government, \n                tribal trust resources, or Indian tribal treaty and \n                other rights, each agency should explore and, where \n                appropriate, use consensual mechanisms for developing \n                regulations, including negotiated rulemaking.\n\n                Sec. 6.

Goals.\n\n                    The Federal Government provides and funds an array \n                of services that can be made accessible to otherwise \n                eligible persons who are not proficient in the English \n                language. The Federal Government is committed to \n                improving the accessibility of these services to \n                eligible LEP persons, a goal that reinforces its \n                equally important commitment to promoting programs and \n                activities designed to help individuals learn English. \n                To this end, each Federal agency shall examine the \n                services it provides and develop and implement a system \n                by which LEP persons can meaningfully access those \n                services consistent with, and without unduly burdening, \n                the fundamental mission of the agency. Each Federal \n                agency shall also work to ensure that recipients of \n                Federal financial assistance (recipients) provide \n                meaningful access to their LEP applicants and \n                beneficiaries. To assist the agencies with this \n                endeavor, the Department of Justice has today issued a \n                general guidance document (LEP Guidance), which sets \n                forth the compliance standards that recipients must \n                follow to ensure that the programs and activities they \n                normally provide in English are accessible to LEP \n                persons and thus do not discriminate on the basis of \n                national origin in violation of title VI of the Civil \n                Rights Act of 1964, as amended, and its implementing \n                regulations. As described in the LEP Guidance, \n                recipients must take reasonable steps to ensure \n                meaningful access to their programs and activities by \n                LEP persons.\n\n                Sec. 2. Federally Conducted Programs and Activities.\n\n                    Each Federal agency shall prepare a plan to improve \n                access to its federally conducted programs and \n                activities by eligible LEP persons. Each plan shall be \n                consistent with the standards set forth in the LEP \n                Guidance, and shall include the steps the agency will \n                take to ensure that eligible LEP persons can \n                meaningfully access the agency's programs and \n                activities. Agencies shall develop and begin to \n                implement these plans within 120 days of the date of \n                this order, and shall send copies of their plans to the \n                Department of Justice, which shall serve as the central \n                repository of the agencies' plans.\n\n                Sec. 3. Federally Assisted Programs and Activities.\n\n                    Each agency providing Federal financial assistance \n                shall draft title VI guidance specifically tailored to \n                its recipients that is consistent with the LEP Guidance \n                issued by the Department of Justice. This agency-\n                specific guidance shall detail how the general \n                standards established in the LEP Guidance will be \n                applied to the agency's recipients. The agency-specific \n                guidance shall take into account the types of services \n                provided by the recipients, the individuals served by \n                the recipients, and other factors set out in the LEP \n                Guidance. Agencies that already have developed title VI \n                guidance that the Department of Justice determines is \n                consistent with the LEP Guidance shall examine their \n                existing guidance, as well as their programs and \n                activities, to determine if additional guidance is \n                necessary to comply with this order. The Department of \n                Justice shall consult with the agencies in creating \n                their guidance and, within 120 days of the date of this \n                order,\n\n[[Page 50122]]\n\n                each agency shall submit its specific guidance to the \n                Department of Justice for review and approval. \n                Following approval by the Department of Justice, each \n                agency shall publish its guidance document in the \n                Federal Register for public comment.\n\n                Sec. 4. Consultations.\n\n                    In carrying out this order, agencies shall ensure \n                that stakeholders, such as LEP persons and their \n                representative organizations, recipients, and other \n                appropriate individuals or entities, have an adequate \n                opportunity to provide input. Agencies will evaluate \n                the particular needs of the LEP persons they and their \n                recipients serve and the burdens of compliance on the \n                agency and its recipients.

Policy. Since World War II, hundreds of \n                thousands of men and women have served their Nation in \n                building its nuclear defense. In the course of their \n                work, they overcame previously unimagined scientific \n                and technical challenges. Thousands of these courageous \n                Americans, however, paid a high price for their \n                service, developing disabling or fatal illnesses as a \n                result of exposure to beryllium, ionizing radiation, \n                and other hazards unique to nuclear weapons production \n                and testing. Too often, these workers were neither \n                adequately protected from, nor informed of, the \n                occupational hazards to which they were exposed.\n\n                Existing workers' compensation programs have failed to \n                provide for the needs of these workers and their \n                families. Federal workers' compensation programs have \n                generally not included these workers. Further, because \n                of long latency periods, the uniqueness of the hazards \n                to which they were exposed, and inadequate exposure \n                data, many of these individuals have been unable to \n                obtain State workers' compensation benefits. This \n                problem has been exacerbated by the past policy of the \n                Department of Energy (DOE) and its predecessors of \n                encouraging and assisting DOE contractors in opposing \n                the claims of workers who sought those benefits. This \n                policy has recently been reversed.\n\n                While the Nation can never fully repay these workers or \n                their families, they deserve recognition and \n                compensation for their sacrifices. Since the \n                Administration's historic announcement in July of 1999 \n                that it intended to compensate DOE nuclear weapons \n                workers who suffered occupational illnesses as a result \n                of exposure to the unique hazards in building the \n                Nation's nuclear defense, it has been the policy of \n                this Administration to support fair and timely \n                compensation for these workers and their survivors. The \n                Federal Government should provide necessary information \n                and otherwise help employees of the DOE or its \n                contractors determine if their illnesses are associated \n                with conditions of their nuclear weapons-related work; \n                it should provide workers and their survivors with all \n                pertinent and available information necessary for \n                evaluating and processing claims; and it should ensure \n                that this program minimizes the administrative burden \n                on workers and their survivors, and respects their \n                dignity and privacy. This order sets out agency \n                responsibilities to accomplish these goals, building on \n                the Administration's articulated principles and the \n                framework set forth in the Energy Employees \n                Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000. \n                The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, \n                and Energy shall be responsible for developing and \n                implementing actions under the Act to compensate these \n                workers and their families in a manner that is \n                compassionate, fair, and timely. Other Federal \n                agencies, as appropriate, shall assist in this effort.\n\n[[Page 77488]]\n\n                Sec. 2.

Any \n                commander of a prisoner, an officer appointed under \n                regulations of the Secretary concerned to conduct the \n                review under subsections (i) and/or (j) of this rule \n                or, once charges have been referred, a military judge \n                detailed to the court-martial to which the charges \n                against the accused have been referred, may direct \n                release from pretrial confinement. For the purposes of \n                this subsection, ``any commander'' includes the \n                immediate or higher commander of the prisoner and the \n                commander of the installation on which the confinement \n                facility is located.\n                    (h) Notification and action by commander.\n                      (1) Report. Unless the commander of the prisoner \n                ordered the pretrial confinement, the commissioned, \n                warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer into whose \n                charge the prisoner was committed shall, within 24 \n                hours after that commitment, cause a report to be made \n                to the commander that shall contain the name of the \n                prisoner, the offenses charged against the prisoner, \n                and the name of the person who ordered or authorized \n                confinement.\n                      (2) Action by commander.\n                        (A) Decision. Not later than 72 hours after the \n                commander's ordering of a prisoner into pretrial \n                confinement or, after receipt of a report that a member \n                of the commander's unit or organization has been \n                confined, whichever situation is applicable, the \n                commander shall decide whether pretrial confinement \n                will continue. A commander's compliance with this \n                subsection may also satisfy the 48-hour probable cause \n                determination of subsection R.C.M. 305(i)(1) below, \n                provided the commander is a neutral and detached \n                officer and acts within 48 hours of the imposition of \n                confinement under military control. Nothing in \n                subsections R.C.M. 305(d), R.C.M. 305(i)(1), or this \n                subsection prevents a neutral and detached commander \n                from completing the 48-hour probable cause \n                determination and the 72-hour commander's decision \n                immediately after an accused is ordered into pretrial \n                confinement.\n                        (B) Requirements for confinement. The commander \n                shall direct the prisoner's release from pretrial \n                confinement unless the commander believes upon probable \n                cause, that is, upon reasonable grounds, that:\n                          (i) An offense triable by a court-martial has \n                been committed;\n                          (ii) The prisoner committed it; and\n\n[[Page 30066]]\n\n                          (iii) Confinement is necessary because it is \n                foreseeable that:\n                            (a) The prisoner will not appear at trial, \n                pretrial hearing, or investigation, or\n                            (b) The prisoner will engage in serious \n                criminal misconduct; and\n                          (iv) Less severe forms of restraint are \n                inadequate.\n                        Serious criminal misconduct includes \n                intimidation of witnesses or other obstruction of \n                justice, serious injury to others, or other offenses \n                that pose a serious threat to the safety of the \n                community or to the effectiveness, morale, discipline, \n                readiness, or safety of the command, or to the national \n                security of the United States. As used in this rule, \n                ``national security'' means the national defense and \n                foreign relations of the United States and specifically \n                includes: military or defense advantage over any \n                foreign nation or group of nations; a favorable foreign \n                relations position; or a defense posture capable of \n                successfully resisting hostile or destructive action \n                from within or without, overt or covert.\n                        (C) 72-hour memorandum. If continued pretrial \n                confinement is approved, the commander shall prepare a \n                written memorandum that states the reasons for the \n                conclusion that the requirements for confinement in \n                subsection (h)(2)(B) of this rule have been met. This \n                memorandum may include hearsay and may incorporate by \n                reference other documents, such as witness statements, \n                investigative reports, or official records. This \n                memorandum shall be forwarded to the 7-day reviewing \n                officer under subsection (i)(2) of this rule. If such a \n                memorandum was prepared by the commander before \n                ordering confinement, a second memorandum need not be \n                prepared; however, additional information may be added \n                to the memorandum at any time.\n                    (i) Procedures for review of pretrial confinement.\n                      (1) 48-hour probable cause determination. Review \n                of the adequacy of probable cause to continue pretrial \n                confinement shall be made by a neutral and detached \n                officer within 48 hours of imposition of confinement \n                under military control. If the prisoner is apprehended \n                by civilian authorities and remains in civilian custody \n                at the request of military authorities, reasonable \n                efforts will be made to bring the prisoner under \n                military control in a timely fashion.\n                      (2) 7-day review of pretrial confinement. Within \n                7 days of the imposition of confinement, a neutral and \n                detached officer appointed in accordance with \n                regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned shall \n                review the probable cause determination and necessity \n                for continued pretrial confinement. In calculating the \n                number of days of confinement for purposes of this \n                rule, the initial date of confinement under military \n                control shall count as one day and the date of the \n                review shall also count as one day.\n                        (A) Nature of the 7-day review.\n                          (i) Matters considered. The review under this \n                subsection shall include a review of the memorandum \n                submitted by the prisoner's commander under subsection \n                (h)(2)(C) of this rule. Additional written matters may \n                be considered, including any submitted by the accused. \n                The prisoner and the prisoner's counsel, if any, shall \n                be allowed to appear before the 7-day reviewing officer \n                and make a statement, if practicable. A representative \n                of the command may also appear before the reviewing \n                officer to make a statement.\n                          (ii) Rules of evidence. Except for Mil. R. \n                Evid., Section V (Privileges) and Mil. R. Evid. 302 and \n                305, the Military Rules of Evidence shall not apply to \n                the matters considered.\n                          (iii) Standard of proof. The requirements for \n                confinement under subsection (h)(2)(B) of this rule \n                must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n[[Page 30067]]\n\n                        (B) Extension of time limit. The 7-day \n                reviewing officer may, for good cause, extend the time \n                limit for completion of the review to 10 days after the \n                imposition of pretrial confinement.\n                        (C) Action by 7-day reviewing officer. Upon \n                completion of review, the reviewing officer shall \n                approve continued confinement or order immediate \n                release.\n                        (D) Memorandum. The 7-day reviewing officer's \n                conclusions, including the factual findings on which \n                they are based, shall be set forth in a written \n                memorandum. A copy of the memorandum and of all \n                documents considered by the 7-day reviewing officer \n                shall be maintained in accordance with regulations \n                prescribed by the Secretary concerned and provided to \n                the accused or the Government on request.\n                        (E) Reconsideration of approval of continued \n                confinement. The 7-day reviewing officer shall upon \n                request, and after notice to the parties, reconsider \n                the decision to confine the prisoner based upon any \n                significant information not previously considered.\n                    (j) Review by military judge. Once the charges for \n                which the accused has been confined are referred to \n                trial, the military judge shall review the propriety of \n                the pretrial confinement upon motion for appropriate \n                relief.\n                      (1) Release. The military judge shall order \n                release from pretrial confinement only if:\n                        (A) The 7-day reviewing officer's decision was \n                an abuse of discretion, and there is not sufficient \n                information presented to the military judge justifying \n                continuation of pretrial confinement under subsection \n                (h)(2)(B) of this rule;\n                        (B) Information not presented to the 7-day \n                reviewing officer establishes that the prisoner should \n                be released under subsection (h)(2)(B) of this rule; or\n                        (C) The provisions of subsection (i)(1) or (2) \n                of this rule have not been complied with and \n                information presented to the military judge does not \n                establish sufficient grounds for continued confinement \n                under subsection (h)(2)(B) of this rule.\n                      (2) Credit. The military judge shall order \n                administrative credit under subsection (k) of this rule \n                for any pretrial confinement served as a result of an \n                abuse of discretion or failure to comply with the \n                provisions of subsections (f), (h), or (i) of this \n                rule.\n                    (k) Remedy. The remedy for noncompliance with \n                subsections (f), (h), (i), or (j) of this rule shall be \n                an administrative credit against the sentence adjudged \n                for any confinement served as the result of such \n                noncompliance. Such credit shall be computed at the \n                rate of 1 day credit for each day of confinement served \n                as a result of such noncompliance. The military judge \n                may order additional credit for each day of pretrial \n                confinement that involves an abuse of discretion or \n                unusually harsh circumstances. This credit is to be \n                applied in addition to any other credit to which the \n                accused may be entitled as a result of pretrial \n                confinement served. This credit shall be applied first \n                against any confinement adjudged. If no confinement is \n                adjudged, or if the confinement adjudged is \n                insufficient to offset all the credit to which the \n                accused is entitled, the credit shall be applied \n                against adjudged hard labor without confinement, \n                restriction, fine, and forfeiture of pay, in that \n                order, using the conversion formula under R.C.M. \n                1003(b)(6) and (7). For purposes of this subsection, 1 \n                day of confinement shall be equal to 1 day of total \n                forfeitures or a like amount of fine. The credit shall \n                not be applied against any other form of punishment.''\n\n[[Page 30068]]\n\n                b. R.C.M. 405(e) is amended to read as follows:\n\n                    ``(e) Scope of investigation. The investigating \n                officer shall inquire into the truth and form of the \n                charges, and such other matters as may be necessary to \n                make a recommendation as to the disposition of the \n                charges. If evidence adduced during the investigation \n                indicates that the accused committed an uncharged \n                offense, the investigating officer may investigate the \n                subject matter of such offense and make a \n                recommendation as to its disposition, without the \n                accused first having been charged with the offense. The \n                accused's rights under subsection (f) are the same with \n                regard to investigation of both charged and uncharged \n                offenses.''\n\n                c. R.C.M. 706(c)(2)(D) is amended to read as follows:\n\n                        ``(D) Is the accused presently suffering from a \n                mental disease or defect rendering the accused unable \n                to understand the nature of the proceedings against the \n                accused or to conduct or cooperate intelligently in the \n                defense of the case?''\n\n                d. R.C.M. 707(b)(3) is amended by adding subsection (E) \n                which reads as follows:\n\n                        ``(E) Commitment of the incompetent accused. If \n                the accused is committed to the custody of the Attorney \n                General for hospitalization as provided in R.C.M. \n                909(f), all periods of such commitment shall be \n                excluded when determining whether the period in \n                subsection (a) of this rule has run. If, at the end of \n                the period of commitment, the accused is returned to \n                the custody of the general court-martial convening \n                authority, a new 120-day time period under this rule \n                shall begin on the date of such return to custody.''\n\n                e. R.C.M. 707(c) is amended to read as follows:\n\n                    ``(c) Excludable delay. All periods of time during \n                which appellate courts have issued stays in the \n                proceedings, or the accused is hospitalized due to \n                incompetence, or is otherwise in the custody of the \n                Attorney General, shall be excluded when determining \n                whether the period in subsection (a) of this rule has \n                run. All other pretrial delays approved by a military \n                judge or the convening authority shall be similarly \n                excluded.''\n\n                f. R.C.M. 809(b)(1) is amended by deleting the last \n                sentence, which reads:\n\n                    ``In such cases, the regular proceedings shall be \n                suspended while the contempt is disposed of.''\n\n                g. R.C.M. 809(c) is amended to read as follows:\n\n                    ``(c) Procedure.

The military judge \n                shall also determine when during the court-martial the \n                contempt proceedings shall be conducted; however, if \n                the court-martial is composed of members, the military \n                judge shall conduct the contempt proceedings outside \n                the members' presence. The military judge may punish \n                summarily under subsection (b)(1) only if the military \n                judge recites the facts for the record and states that \n                they were directly witnessed by the military judge in \n                the actual presence of the court-martial. Otherwise, \n                the provisions of subsection (b)(2) shall apply.''\n\n                h. R.C.M. 908(a) is amended to read as follows:\n\n                    ``(a) In general. In a trial by a court-martial \n                over which a military judge presides and in which a \n                punitive discharge may be adjudged, the United States \n                may appeal an order or ruling that terminates the \n                proceedings with respect to a charge or specification, \n                or excludes evidence that is substantial proof of a \n                fact material in the proceedings, or directs the \n                disclosure of classified information, or that imposes \n                sanctions for nondisclosure of classified information. \n                The United States may also appeal a refusal by the \n                military judge to issue a protective order sought by \n                the United States to prevent the disclosure of \n                classified information or to enforce such an order that \n                has previously been issued by the appropriate \n                authority.

A person is presumed \n                to have the capacity to stand trial unless the contrary \n                is established.\n                    (c) Determination before referral. If an inquiry \n                pursuant to R.C.M. 706 conducted before referral \n                concludes that an accused is suffering from a mental \n                disease or defect that renders him or her mentally \n                incompetent to stand trial, the convening authority \n                before whom the charges are pending for disposition may \n                disagree with the conclusion and take any action \n                authorized under R.C.M. 401, including referral of the \n                charges to trial. If that convening authority concurs \n                with the conclusion, he or she shall forward the \n                charges to the general court-martial convening \n                authority. If, upon receipt of the charges, the general \n                court-martial convening authority similarly concurs, \n                then he or she shall commit the accused to the custody \n                of the Attorney General. If the general court-martial \n                convening authority does not concur, that authority may \n                take any action that he or she deems appropriate in \n                accordance with R.C.M. 407, including referral of the \n                charges to trial.\n                    (d) Determination after referral. After referral, \n                the military judge may conduct a hearing to determine \n                the mental capacity of the accused, either sua sponte \n                or upon request of either party. If an inquiry pursuant \n                to R.C.M. 706 conducted before or after referral \n                concludes that an accused is suffering from a mental \n                disease or defect that renders him or her mentally \n                incompetent to stand trial, the military judge shall \n                conduct a hearing to determine the mental capacity of \n                the accused. Any such hearing shall be conducted in \n                accordance with paragraph (e) of this rule.\n                    (e) Incompetence determination hearing.\n                      (1) Nature of issue. The mental capacity of the \n                accused is an interlocutory question of fact.\n                      (2) Standard. Trial may proceed unless it is \n                established by a preponderance of the evidence that the \n                accused is presently suffering from a mental disease or \n                defect rendering him or her mentally incompetent to the \n                extent that he or she is unable to understand the \n                nature of the proceedings or to conduct or cooperate \n                intelligently in the defense of the case. In making \n                this determination, the military judge is not bound by \n                the rules of evidence except with respect to \n                privileges.\n                      (3) If the military judge finds the accused is \n                incompetent to stand trial, the judge shall report this \n                finding to the general court-martial convening \n                authority, who shall commit the accused to the custody \n                of the Attorney General.\n                    (f) Hospitalization of the accused. An accused who \n                is found incompetent to stand trial under this rule \n                shall be hospitalized by the Attorney General as \n                provided in section 4241(d) of title 18, United States \n                Code. If notified that the accused has recovered to \n                such an extent that he or she is able to understand the \n                nature of the proceedings and to conduct or cooperate \n                intelligently in the defense of the case, then the \n                general court-martial convening authority shall \n                promptly take custody of the accused. If, at the end of \n                the period of hospitalization, the accused's mental \n                condition has not so improved, action shall be taken in \n                accordance with section 4246 of title 18, United States \n                Code.\n                    (g) Excludable delay. All periods of commitment \n                shall be excluded as provided by R.C.M. 707(c). The \n                120-day time period under R.C.M. 707 shall begin anew \n                on the date the general court-martial convening \n                authority takes custody of the accused at the end of \n                any period of commitment.''\n\n[[Page 30070]]\n\n                j. R.C.M. 916(b) is amended to read as follows:\n\n                    ``(b) Burden of proof. Except for the defense of \n                lack of mental responsibility and the defense of \n                mistake of fact as to age as described in Part IV, \n                para. 45c.(2) in a prosecution for carnal knowledge, \n                the prosecution shall have the burden of proving beyond \n                a reasonable doubt that the defense did not exist. The \n                accused has the burden of proving the defense of lack \n                of mental responsibility by clear and convincing \n                evidence, and has the burden of proving mistake of fact \n                as to age in a carnal knowledge prosecution by a \n                preponderance of the evidence.''\n\n                k.

Except as otherwise provided in \n                this subsection, it is a defense to an offense that the \n                accused held, as a result of ignorance or mistake, an \n                incorrect belief of the true circumstances such that, \n                if the circumstances were as the accused believed them, \n                the accused would not be guilty of the offense. If the \n                ignorance or mistake goes to an element requiring \n                premeditation, specific intent, willfulness, or \n                knowledge of a particular fact, the ignorance or \n                mistake need only have existed in the mind of the \n                accused. If the ignorance or mistake goes to any other \n                element requiring only general intent or knowledge, the \n                ignorance or mistake must have existed in the mind of \n                the accused and must have been reasonable under all the \n                circumstances. However, if the accused's knowledge or \n                intent is immaterial as to an element, then ignorance \n                or mistake is not a defense.\n                      (2) Carnal knowledge. It is a defense to a \n                prosecution for carnal knowledge that, at the time of \n                the sexual intercourse, the person with whom the \n                accused had sexual intercourse was at least 12 years of \n                age, and the accused reasonably believed the person was \n                at least 16 years of age. The accused must prove this \n                defense by a preponderance of the evidence.''\n\n                l. R.C.M. 920(e)(5)(D) is amended to read as follows:\n\n                        ``(D) The burden of proof to establish the \n                guilt of the accused is upon the Government.

R.C.M. 1101(c) is amended as follows:\n\n                    ``(c) Deferment of confinement, forfeitures or \n                reduction in grade.\n                      (1) In general. Deferment of a sentence to \n                confinement, forfeitures, or reduction in grade is a \n                postponement of the running of a sentence.\n                      (2) Who may defer. The convening authority or, if \n                the accused is no longer in the convening authority's \n                jurisdiction, the officer exercising general court-\n                martial jurisdiction over the command to which the \n                accused is assigned, may, upon written application of \n                the accused at any time after the adjournment of the \n                court-martial, defer the accused's service of a \n                sentence to confinement, forfeitures, or reduction in \n                grade that has not been ordered executed.\n                      (3) Action on deferment request. The authority \n                acting on the deferment request may, in that \n                authority's discretion, defer service of a sentence to \n                confinement, forfeitures, or reduction in grade. The \n                accused shall have the burden of showing that the \n                interests of the accused and the community in deferral \n                outweigh the community's interest in imposition of the \n                punishment on its effective date. Factors that the \n                authority acting on a deferment request may consider in \n                determining whether to grant the deferment request \n                include, where applicable: the probability of the \n                accused's flight; the probability of the accused's \n                commission of other offenses, intimidation of \n                witnesses, or interference with the administration of \n                justice; the nature of the offenses (including the \n                effect on the victim) of which the accused was \n                convicted; the sentence adjudged; the command's \n                immediate need for the accused; the effect of deferment \n                on good order and discipline in the command; the \n                accused's character, mental condition, family \n                situation, and service record. The decision of the \n                authority acting on the deferment request shall be \n                subject to judicial review only for abuse of \n                discretion. The action of the authority acting on the \n                deferment request shall be in writing and a copy shall \n                be provided to the accused.\n                      (4) Orders. The action granting deferment shall \n                be reported in the convening authority's action under \n                R.C.M. 1107(f)(4)(E) and shall include the date of the \n                action on the request when it occurs prior to or \n                concurrently with the action. Action granting deferment \n                after the convening authority's action under R.C.M. \n                1107 shall be reported in orders under R.C.M. 1114 and \n                included in the record of trial.\n                      (5) Restraint when deferment is granted. When \n                deferment of confinement is granted, no form of \n                restraint or other limitation on the accused's liberty \n                may be ordered as a substitute form of punishment. An \n                accused may, however, be restricted to specified limits \n                or conditions may be placed on the accused's liberty \n                during the period of deferment for any other proper \n                reason, including a ground for restraint under R.C.M. \n                304.\n                      (6) End of deferment. Deferment of a sentence to \n                confinement, forfeitures, or reduction in grade ends \n                when:\n                        (A) The convening authority takes action under \n                R.C.M. 1107, unless the convening authority specifies \n                in the action that service of confinement after the \n                action is deferred;\n                        (B) The confinement, forfeitures, or reduction \n                in grade are suspended;\n                        (C) The deferment expires by its own terms; or\n                        (D) The deferment is otherwise rescinded in \n                accordance with subsection (c)(7) of this rule. \n                Deferment of confinement may not continue after the \n                conviction is final under R.C.M. 1209.\n                      (7) Rescission of deferment.\n                        (A) Who may rescind. The authority who granted \n                the deferment or, if the accused is no longer within \n                that authority's jurisdiction, the officer exercising \n                general court-martial jurisdiction over the command to \n                which the accused is assigned, may rescind the \n                deferment.\n                        (B) Action. Deferment of confinement, \n                forfeitures, or reduction in grade may be rescinded \n                when additional information is presented to a proper\n\n[[Page 30072]]\n\n                authority which, when considered with all other \n                information in the case, that authority finds, in that \n                authority's discretion, is grounds for denial of \n                deferment under subsection (c)(3) of this rule. The \n                accused shall promptly be informed of the basis for the \n                rescission and of the right to submit written matters \n                on the accused's behalf and to request that the \n                rescission be reconsidered. However, the accused may be \n                required to serve the sentence to confinement, \n                forfeitures, or reduction in grade pending this action.\n                        (C) Execution. When deferment of confinement is \n                rescinded after the convening authority's action under \n                R.C.M. 1107, the confinement may be ordered executed. \n                However, no such order to rescind a deferment of \n                confinement may be issued within 7 days of notice of \n                the rescission of a deferment of confinement to the \n                accused under subsection (c)(7)(B) of this rule, to \n                afford the accused an opportunity to respond. The \n                authority rescinding the deferment may extend this \n                period for good cause shown. The accused shall be \n                credited with any confinement actually served during \n                this period.\n                        (D) Orders. Rescission of a deferment before or \n                concurrently with the initial action in the case shall \n                be reported in the action under R.C.M. 1107(f)(4)(E), \n                which action shall include the dates of the granting of \n                the deferment and the rescission. Rescission of a \n                deferment of confinement after the convening \n                authority's action shall be reported in supplementary \n                orders in accordance with R.C.M. 1114 and shall state \n                whether the approved period of confinement is to be \n                executed or whether all or part of it is to be \n                suspended.''\n\n                p. R.C.M. 101 is amended by adding the following new \n                subparagraph (d):\n\n                    ``(d) Waiving forfeitures resulting from a sentence \n                to confinement to provide for dependent support.\n                      (1) With respect to forfeiture of pay and \n                allowances resulting only by operation of law and not \n                adjudged by the court, the convening authority may \n                waive, for a period not to exceed six months, all or \n                part of the forfeitures for the purpose of providing \n                support to the accused's dependent(s). The convening \n                authority may waive and direct payment of any such \n                forfeitures when they become effective by operation of \n                Article 57(a).\n                      (2) Factors that may be considered by the \n                convening authority in determining the amount of \n                forfeitures, if any, to be waived include, but are not \n                limited to, the length of the accused's confinement, \n                the number and age(s) of the accused's family members, \n                whether the accused requested waiver, any debts owed by \n                the accused, the ability of the accused's family \n                members to find employment, and the availability of \n                transitional compensation for abused dependents \n                permitted under 10 U.S.C. 1059.\n                      (3) For the purposes of this Rule, a \n                ``dependent'' means any person qualifying as a \n                ``dependent'' under 37 U.S.C. 401.''\n\n                q. The following new rule is added after R.C.M. 1102:\n\n                ``Rule 1102A. Post-trial hearing for person found not \n                guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility\n\n                    (a) In general. The military judge shall conduct a \n                hearing not later than forty days following the finding \n                that an accused is not guilty only by reason of a lack \n                of mental responsibility.\n                    (b) Psychiatric or psychological examination and \n                report. Prior to the hearing, the military judge or \n                convening authority shall order a psychiatric or \n                psychological examination of the accused, with the \n                resulting psychiatric or psychological report \n                transmitted to the military judge for use in the post-\n                trial hearing.\n                    (c) Post-trial hearing.\n                      (1) The accused shall be represented by defense \n                counsel and shall have the opportunity to testify, \n                present evidence, call witnesses on his or her behalf, \n                and to confront and cross-examine witnesses who appear \n                at the hearing.\n\n[[Page 30073]]\n\n                      (2) The military judge is not bound by the rules \n                of evidence except with respect to privileges.\n                      (3) An accused found not guilty only by reason of \n                a lack of mental responsibility of an offense involving \n                bodily injury to another, or serious damage to the \n                property of another, or involving a substantial risk of \n                such injury or damage, has the burden of proving by \n                clear and convincing evidence that his or her release \n                would not create a substantial risk of bodily injury to \n                another person or serious damage to property of another \n                due to a present mental disease or defect.

If, however, the military judge finds after \n                the hearing that the accused has not satisfied the \n                standard specified in subsection (3) of this section, \n                then the military judge shall inform the general court-\n                martial convening authority of this result and that \n                authority may commit the accused to the custody of the \n                Attorney General.''\n\n                r.

When an accused is found not \n                guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility, \n                the convening authority, however, shall commit the \n                accused to a suitable facility pending a hearing and \n                disposition in accordance with R.C.M. 1102A.''\n\n                t.

R.C.M. 1109 is amended to read as follows:\n\n                ``Rule 1109. Vacation of suspension of sentence\n\n[[Page 30074]]\n\n                    (a) In general. Suspension of execution of the \n                sentence of a court-martial may be vacated for \n                violation of the conditions of the suspension as \n                provided in this rule.\n                    (b) Timeliness.\n                      (1) Violation of conditions. Vacation shall be \n                based on a violation of the conditions of suspension \n                that occurs within the period of suspension.\n                      (2) Vacation proceedings. Vacation proceedings \n                under this rule shall be completed within a reasonable \n                time.\n                      (3) Order vacating the suspension. The order \n                vacating the suspension shall be issued before the \n                expiration of the period of suspension.\n                      (4) Interruptions to the period of suspension. \n                Unauthorized absence of the probationer or the \n                commencement of proceedings under this rule to vacate \n                suspension interrupts the running of the period of \n                suspension.\n                    (c) Confinement of probationer pending vacation \n                proceedings.\n                      (1) In general. A probationer under a suspended \n                sentence to confinement may be confined pending action \n                under subsection (d)(2) of this rule, in accordance \n                with the procedures in this subsection.\n                      (2) Who may order confinement.

A probationer under a \n                suspended sentence to confinement may be ordered into \n                confinement upon probable cause to believe the \n                probationer violated any conditions of the suspension.\n                      (4) Review of confinement. Unless proceedings \n                under subsection (d)(1), (e), (f), or (g) of this rule \n                are completed within 7 days of imposition of \n                confinement of the probationer (not including any \n                delays requested by probationer), a preliminary hearing \n                shall be conducted by a neutral and detached officer \n                appointed in accordance with regulations of the \n                Secretary concerned.\n                        (A) Rights of accused. Before the preliminary \n                hearing, the accused shall be notified in writing of:\n                          (i) The time, place, and purpose of the \n                hearing, including the alleged violation(s) of the \n                conditions of suspension;\n                          (ii) The right to be present at the hearing;\n                          (iii) The right to be represented at the \n                hearing by civilian counsel provided by the probationer \n                or, upon request, by military counsel detailed for this \n                purpose; and\n                          (iv) The opportunity to be heard, to present \n                witnesses who are reasonably available and other \n                evidence, and the right to confront and cross-examine \n                adverse witnesses unless the hearing officer determines \n                that this would subject these witnesses to risk or \n                harm. For purposes of this subsection, a witness is not \n                reasonably available if the witness requires \n                reimbursement by the United States for cost incurred in \n                appearing, cannot appear without unduly delaying the \n                proceedings or, if a military witness, cannot be \n                excused from other important duties.\n                        (B) Rules of evidence. Except for Mil. R. Evid. \n                Section V (Privileges) and Mil. R. Evid. 302 and 305, \n                the Military Rules of Evidence shall not apply to \n                matters considered at the preliminary hearing under \n                this rule.\n                        (C) Decision. The hearing officer shall \n                determine whether there is probable cause to believe \n                that the probationer violated the conditions of the \n                probationer's suspension. If the hearing officer \n                determines that probable cause is lacking, the hearing \n                officer shall issue a written order directing that the \n                probationer be released from confinement. If the \n                hearing officer determines that there is probable cause \n                to believe that the probationer violated the conditions \n                of suspension, the hearing officer shall set forth that \n                decision in a written memorandum, detailing therein the \n                evidence relied\n\n[[Page 30075]]\n\n                upon and reasons for making the decision. The hearing \n                officer shall forward the original memorandum or \n                release order to the probationer's commander and \n                forward a copy to the probationer and the officer in \n                charge of the confinement facility.\n                    (d) Vacation of suspended general court-martial \n                sentence.\n                      (1) Action by officer having special court-\n                martial jurisdiction over probationer.\n                        (A) In general. Before vacation of the \n                suspension of any general court-martial sentence, the \n                officer having special court-martial jurisdiction over \n                the probationer shall personally hold a hearing on the \n                alleged violation of the conditions of suspension. If \n                there is no officer having special court-martial \n                jurisdiction over the probationer who is subordinate to \n                the officer having general court-martial jurisdiction \n                over the probationer, the officer exercising general \n                court-martial jurisdiction over the probationer shall \n                personally hold a hearing under subsection (d)(1) of \n                this rule. In such cases, subsection (d)(1)(D) of this \n                rule shall not apply.\n                        (B) Notice to probationer. Before the hearing, \n                the officer conducting the hearing shall cause the \n                probationer to be notified in writing of:\n                          (i) The time, place, and purpose of the \n                hearing;\n                          (ii) The right to be present at the hearing;\n                          (iii) The alleged violation(s) of the \n                conditions of suspension and the evidence expected to \n                be relied on;\n                          (iv) The right to be represented at the \n                hearing by civilian counsel provided by the probationer \n                or, upon request, by military counsel detailed for this \n                purpose; and\n                          (v) The opportunity to be heard, to present \n                witnesses and other evidence, and the right to confront \n                and cross-examine adverse witnesses, unless the hearing \n                officer determines that there is good cause for not \n                allowing confrontation and cross-examination.\n                        (C) Hearing. The procedure for the vacation \n                hearing shall follow that prescribed in R.C.M. 405(g), \n                (h)(1), and (i).\n                        (D) Record and recommendation. The officer who \n                conducts the vacation proceeding shall make a \n                summarized record of the proceeding and forward the \n                record and that officer's written recommendation \n                concerning vacation to the officer exercising general \n                court-martial jurisdiction over the probationer.\n                        (E) Release from confinement. If the special \n                court-martial convening authority finds there is not \n                probable cause to believe that the probationer violated \n                the conditions of the suspension, the special court-\n                martial convening authority shall order the release of \n                the probationer from confinement ordered under \n                subsection (c) of this rule. The special court-martial \n                convening authority shall, in any event, forward the \n                record and recommendation under subsection (d)(1)(D) of \n                this rule.\n                      (2) Action by officer exercising general court-\n                martial jurisdiction over probationer.\n                        (A) In general. The officer exercising general \n                court-martial jurisdiction over the probationer shall \n                review the record produced by and the recommendation of \n                the officer exercising special court-martial \n                jurisdiction over the probationer, decide whether the \n                probationer violated a condition of suspension, and, if \n                so, decide whether to vacate the suspended sentence.

[Note: If the escape was from post-trial \n                confinement, add the following element]\n                        (d) That the confinement was the result of a \n                court-martial conviction.\n                    c. Explanation.\n                      (1) Resisting apprehension.\n                        (a) Apprehension. Apprehension is the taking of \n                a person into custody. See R.C.M. 302.\n                        (b) Authority to apprehend. See R.C.M. 302(b) \n                concerning who may apprehend. Whether the status of a \n                person authorized that person to apprehend the accused \n                is a question of law to be decided by the military \n                judge. Whether the person who attempted to make an \n                apprehension had such a status is a question of fact to \n                be decided by the factfinder.\n                        (c) Nature of the resistance. The resistance \n                must be active, such as assaulting the person \n                attempting to apprehend. Mere words of opposition, \n                argument, or abuse, and attempts to escape from custody \n                after the apprehension is complete, do not constitute \n                the offense of resisting apprehension although they may \n                constitute other offenses.\n                      (d) Mistake. It is a defense that the accused \n                held a reasonable belief that the person attempting to \n                apprehend did not have authority to do so. However, the \n                accused's belief at the time that no basis existed for \n                the apprehension is not a defense.\n                        (e) Illegal apprehension. A person may not be \n                convicted of resisting apprehension if the attempted \n                apprehension is illegal, but may be convicted of other \n                offenses, such as assault, depending on all the \n                circumstances. An attempted apprehension by a person \n                authorized to apprehend is presumed\n\n[[Page 30082]]\n\n                to be legal in the absence of evidence to the contrary. \n                Ordinarily the legality of an apprehension is a \n                question of law to be decided by the military judge.\n                      (2) Flight from apprehension. The flight must be \n                active, such as running or driving away.\n                      (3) Breaking arrest.\n                        (a) Arrest. There are two types of arrest: \n                pretrial arrest under Article 9 (see R.C.M. 304), and \n                arrest under Article 15 (see paragraph 5c.(3), Part V, \n                MCM). This article prohibits breaking any arrest.\n                        (b) Authority to order arrest. See R.C.M. \n                304(b) and paragraphs 2 and 5b, Part V, MCM, concerning \n                authority to order arrest.\n                        (c) Nature of restraint imposed by arrest. In \n                arrest, the restraint is moral restraint imposed by \n                orders fixing the limits of arrest.\n                        (d) Breaking. Breaking arrest is committed when \n                the person in arrest infringes the limits set by \n                orders. The reason for the infringement is immaterial. \n                For example, innocence of the offense with respect to \n                which an arrest may have been imposed is not a defense.\n                        (e) Illegal arrest. A person may not be \n                convicted of breaking arrest if the arrest is illegal. \n                An arrest ordered by one authorized to do so is \n                presumed to be legal in the absence of some evidence to \n                the contrary. Ordinarily, the legality of an arrest is \n                a question of law to be decided by the military judge.\n                      (4) Escape from custody.\n                        (a) Custody. ``Custody'' is restraint of free \n                locomotion imposed by lawful apprehension. The \n                restraint may be physical or, once there has been a \n                submission to apprehension or a forcible taking into \n                custody, it may consist of control exercised in the \n                presence of the prisoner by official acts or orders. \n                Custody is temporary restraint intended to continue \n                until other restraint (arrest, restriction, \n                confinement) is imposed or the person is released.\n                        (b) Authority to apprehend. See subparagraph \n                (1)(b) above.\n                        (c) Escape. For a discussion of escape, see \n                subparagraph c(5)(c), below.\n                        (d) Illegal custody. A person may not be \n                convicted of this offense if the custody was illegal. \n                An apprehension effected by one authorized to apprehend \n                is presumed to be lawful in the absence of evidence to \n                the contrary. Ordinarily, the legality of an \n                apprehension is a question of law to be decided by the \n                military judge.\n                        (e) Correctional custody. See paragraph 70.\n                      (5) Escape from confinement.\n                        (a) Confinement. Confinement is physical \n                restraint imposed under R.C.M. 305, 1101, or paragraph \n                5b, Part V, MCM. For purposes of the element of post-\n                trial confinement (subparagraph b(5)(d), above) and \n                increased punishment therefrom (subparagraph e(4), \n                below), the confinement must have been imposed pursuant \n                to an adjudged sentence of a court-martial, and not as \n                a result of pretrial restraint or nonjudicial \n                punishment.\n                        (b) Authority to order confinement. See R.C.M. \n                304(b), 1101, and paragraphs 2 and 5b, Part V, MCM, \n                concerning who may order confinement.\n                        (c) Escape. An escape may be either with or \n                without force or artifice, and either with or without \n                the consent of the custodian. However, where a prisoner \n                is released by one with apparent authority to do so, \n                the prisoner may not be convicted of escape from \n                confinement. See also paragraph 20c.(l)(b). Any \n                completed casting off of the restraint of confinement, \n                before release by proper authority, is an escape, and \n                lack of effectiveness of the restraint imposed is \n                immaterial. An escape is not complete until the \n                prisoner is momentarily free from the restraint. If the \n                movement toward escape is\n\n[[Page 30083]]\n\n                opposed, or before it is completed, an immediate \n                pursuit follows, there is no escape until opposition is \n                overcome or pursuit is eluded.\n                        (d) Status when temporarily outside confinement \n                facility. A prisoner who is temporarily escorted \n                outside a confinement facility for a work detail or \n                other reason by a guard, who has both the duty and \n                means to prevent that prisoner from escaping, remains \n                in confinement.\n                        (e) Legality of confinement. A person may not \n                be convicted of escape from confinement if the \n                confinement is illegal. Confinement ordered by one \n                authorized to do so is presumed to be lawful in the \n                absence of evidence to the contrary. Ordinarily, the \n                legality of confinement is a question of law to be \n                decided by the military judge.\n                    d.

Elements.\n                      (1) That the accused was a prisoner as the result \n                of a court-martial conviction or other criminal \n                proceeding;\n                      (2) That the accused was on parole;\n                      (3) That there were certain conditions of parole \n                that the parolee was bound to obey;\n                      (4) That the accused violated the conditions of \n                parole by doing an act or failing to do an act; and\n                      (5) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of \n                the accused was to the prejudice of good order and \n                discipline in the armed forces or was of a nature to \n                bring discredit upon the armed forces.\n                    c. Explanation.\n                      (1) ``Prisoner'' refers only to those in \n                confinement resulting from conviction at a court-\n                martial or other criminal proceeding.\n                      (2) ``Parole'' is defined as ``word of honor.'' A \n                prisoner on parole, or parolee, has agreed to adhere to \n                a parole plan and conditions of parole. A ``parole \n                plan'' is a written or oral agreement made by the \n                prisoner prior to parole to do or refrain from doing \n                certain acts or activities. A parole plan may include a \n                residence requirement stating where and with whom a \n                parolee will live, and a requirement that the prisoner \n                have an offer of guaranteed employment. ``Conditions of \n                parole'' include the parole plan and other reasonable \n                and appropriate conditions of parole, such as paying \n                restitution, beginning or continuing treatment for \n                alcohol or drug abuse, or paying a fine ordered \n                executed as part of the prisoner's court-martial \n                sentence. In return for giving his or her ``word of \n                honor'' to abide by a parole plan and conditions of \n                parole, the prisoner is granted parole.\n                    d.

The Discussion following R.C.M. 703(e)(2)(G)(i) is \n                amended by adding the following sentence at the end of \n                the second paragraph:\n\n                    ``Failing to comply with such a subpoena is a \n                felony offense, and may result in a fine or \n                imprisonment, or both, at the discretion of the \n                district court.''\n\n                d. The following Discussion is inserted after the first \n                two sentences of R.C.M. 707(c):\n\n                    ``Periods during which the accused is hospitalized \n                due to incompetence or otherwise in the custody of the \n                Attorney General are excluded when determining speedy \n                trial under this rule.''\n\n                e. The following Discussion is added after R.C.M. \n                909(f):\n\n                    ``Under section 4241(d) of title 18, the initial \n                period of hospitalization for an incompetent accused \n                shall not exceed four months. However, in determining \n                whether there is a substantial probability the accused \n                will attain the capacity to permit the trial to proceed \n                in the foreseeable future, the accused may be \n                hospitalized for an additional reasonable period of \n                time.\n                    This additional period of time ends either when the \n                accused's mental condition is improved so that trial \n                may proceed, or when the pending\n\n[[Page 30087]]\n\n                charges against the accused are dismissed. If charges \n                are dismissed solely due to the accused's mental \n                condition, the accused is subject to hospitalization as \n                provided in section 4246 of title 18.''\n\n                f. The Discussion following R.C.M. 916(j) is amended by \n                inserting the following paragraph after the third \n                paragraph in the Discussion:\n\n                    ``Examples of offenses in which the accused's \n                intent or knowledge is immaterial include: carnal \n                knowledge (if the victim is under 12 years of age, \n                knowledge or belief as to age is immaterial) and \n                improper use of countersign (mistake as to authority of \n                person to whom disclosed not a defense).

The Discussion following R.C.M. 1003(b)(2) is \n                amended by adding the following at the end of the \n                Discussion:\n\n                    ``Forfeiture of pay and allowances under Article \n                58b is not a part of the sentence, but is an \n                administrative result thereof.\n                    At general courts-martial, if both a punitive \n                discharge and confinement are adjudged, then the \n                operation of Article 58b results in total forfeiture of \n                pay and allowances during that period of confinement. \n                If only confinement is adjudged, then if that \n                confinement exceeds six months, the operation of \n                Article 58b results in total forfeiture of pay and \n                allowances during that period of confinement. If only a \n                punitive discharge is adjudged, Article 58b has no \n                effect on pay and allowances. A death sentence results \n                in total forfeiture of pay and allowances.\n                    At a special court-martial, if a bad-conduct \n                discharge and confinement are adjudged, then the \n                operation of Article 58b results in a forfeiture of \n                two-thirds of pay only during that period of \n                confinement. If only confinement is adjudged, however, \n                then Article 58b has no effect on adjudged forfeitures.\n                    If the sentence, as approved by the convening \n                authority or other competent authority, does not result \n                in forfeitures by the operation of Article 58b, then \n                only adjudged forfeitures are effective.\n                    Article 58b has no effect on summary courts-\n                martial.''\n\n                i. The Discussion following R.C.M. 1101(c)(6) is \n                amended to read as follows:\n\n                    ``When the sentence is ordered executed, \n                forfeitures or reduction in grade may be suspended, but \n                may not be deferred; deferral of confinement may \n                continue after action in accordance with R.C.M. 1107. A \n                form of punishment cannot be both deferred and \n                suspended at the same time. When deferment of \n                confinement, forfeitures, or reduction in grade ends, \n                the sentence to confinement, forfeitures, or reduction \n                in grade begins to run or resumes running, as \n                appropriate. When the convening authority has specified \n                in the action that confinement will be deferred after \n                the action, the deferment may not be terminated, except \n                under subsections (6)(B), (C), or (D), until the \n                conviction is final under R.C.M. 1209.\n                    See R.C.M. 1203 for deferment of a sentence to \n                confinement pending review under Article 67(a)(2).''\n\n                j. The following Discussion is added after R.C.M. \n                1101(d):\n\n                    ``Forfeitures resulting by operation of law, rather \n                than those adjudged as part of a sentence, may be \n                waived for six months or for the duration of the period \n                of confinement, whichever is less. The waived \n                forfeitures are paid as support to dependent(s) \n                designated by the convening authority.

Burnett, 27 M.J. 99, 106 (C.M.A. \n                1988). Thus, the amendment simplifies the contempt \n                procedure in trials by courts-martial by vesting \n                contempt power in the military judge and eliminating \n                the members' involvement in the process.

The proceedings will be conducted by the \n                military judge in all cases, outside of the members' \n                presence. The military judge also exercises discretion \n                as to the timing of the proceedings and, therefore, may \n                assure that the court-martial is not otherwise \n                unnecessarily disrupted or the accused prejudiced by \n                the contempt proceedings.

Changes to Appendix 22, the Analysis accompanying \n                the Military Rules of Evidence (Part III, MCM).\n\n                a. M.R.E. 412. The analysis accompanying M.R.E. 412 is \n                amended by inserting the following at the end thereof:\n\n                    ``1998 Amendment:'' The revisions to Rule 412 \n                reflect changes made to Federal Rule of Evidence 412 by \n                section 40141 of the Violent Crime Control and Law \n                Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub L. No. 103-322, 108 Stat. \n                1796, 1918-19 (1994). The purpose of the amendments is \n                to safeguard the alleged victim against the invasion of \n                privacy and potential embarrassment that is associated \n                with public disclosure of intimate sexual details and \n                the infusion of sexual innuendo into the factfinding \n                process.\n                    The terminology ``alleged victim'' is used because \n                there will frequently be a factual dispute as to \n                whether the sexual misconduct occurred. Rule 412 does \n                not, however, apply unless the person against whom the \n                evidence is offered can reasonably be characterized as \n                a ``victim of alleged sexual misconduct.''\n                    The term ``sexual predisposition'' is added to Rule \n                412 to conform military practice to changes made to the \n                Federal Rule. The purpose of this change is to exclude \n                all other evidence relating to an alleged victim of \n                sexual misconduct that is offered to prove a sexual \n                predisposition. It is designed to exclude evidence that \n                does not directly refer to sexual activities or \n                thoughts but that the accused believes may have a \n                sexual connotation for the factfinder. Admission of \n                such evidence would contravene Rule 412's objectives of \n                shielding the alleged victim from potential \n                embarrassment and safeguarding the victim against \n                stereotypical thinking. Consequently, unless an \n                exception under (b)(1) is satisfied, evidence such as \n                that relating to the alleged victim's mode of dress, \n                speech, or lifestyle is inadmissible.\n                    In drafting Rule 412, references to civil \n                proceedings were deleted, as these are irrelevant to \n                courts-martial practice. Otherwise, changes in \n                procedure made to the Federal Rule were incorporated, \n                but tailored to military practice. The Military Rule \n                adopts a 5-day notice period, instead of the 14-day \n                period specified in the Federal Rule. Additionally, the \n                military judge, for good cause shown, may require a \n                different time for such notice or permit notice during \n                trial. The 5-day period preserves the intent of the \n                Federal Rule that an alleged victim receive timely \n                notice of any attempt to offer evidence protected by \n                Rule 412, however, given the relatively short time \n                period between referral and trial, the 5-day period is \n                deemed more compatible with courts-martial practice.\n                    Similarly, a closed hearing was substituted for the \n                in camera hearing required by the Federal Rule. Given \n                the nature of the in camera procedure used in Military \n                Rule of Evidence 505(i)(4), and that an in camera \n                hearing in the district courts more closely resembles a \n                closed hearing conducted pursuant to Article 39(a), the \n                latter was adopted as better suited to trial by courts-\n                martial. Any alleged victim is afforded a reasonable \n                opportunity to attend and be heard at the closed \n                Article 39(a) hearing. The closed hearing, combined \n                with the new requirement to seal the motion, related \n                papers, and the record of the hearing, fully protects \n                an alleged victim against invasion of privacy and \n                potential embarrassment.''\n\n                b. M.R.E. 413. The analysis accompanying M.R.E. 413 is \n                added as follows:\n\n                    ``1998 Amendment:'' This amendment is intended to \n                provide for more liberal admissibility of character \n                evidence in criminal cases of sexual assault where the \n                accused has committed a prior act of sexual assault.\n                    Rule 413 is nearly identical to its Federal Rule \n                counterpart. A number of changes were made, however, to \n                tailor the Rule to military practice. First, all \n                references to Federal Rule 415 were deleted, as it \n                applies only to civil proceedings. Second, military \n                justice terminology was substituted where appropriate \n                (e.g. accused for defendant, court-martial for case). \n                Third, the 5-day notice requirement in Rule 413(b) \n                replaced a 15-day notice requirement in the Federal \n                Rule. A 5-day requirement is better suited to military\n\n[[Page 30093]]\n\n                discovery practice. This 5-day notice requirement, \n                however, is not intended to restrict a military judge's \n                authority to grant a continuance under R.C.M. \n                906(b)(1). Fourth, Rule 413(d) has been modified to \n                include violations of the Uniform Code of Military \n                Justice. Also, the phrase ``without consent'' was added \n                to Rule 413(d)(1) to specifically exclude the \n                introduction of evidence concerning adultery or \n                consensual sodomy. Last, all incorporation by way of \n                reference was removed by adding subsections (e), (f), \n                and (g). The definitions in those subsections were \n                taken from title 18, United States Code \n                Sec. Sec. 2246(2), 2246(3), and 513(c)(5), \n                respectively.\n                    Although the Rule states that the evidence ``is \n                admissible,'' the drafters intend that the courts apply \n                Rule 403 balancing to such evidence. Apparently, this \n                also was the intent of Congress. The legislative \n                history reveals that ``the general standards of the \n                rules of evidence will continue to apply, including the \n                restrictions on hearsay evidence and the court's \n                authority under evidence rule 403 to exclude evidence \n                whose probative value is substantially outweighed by \n                its prejudicial effect.'' 140 Cong.

Changes to Appendix 23, the Analysis accompanying \n                the Punitive Articles (Part IV, MCM).\n\n                a. Article 95--Resistance, flight, breach of arrest and \n                escape. The following analysis is inserted after the \n                analysis to Article 95:\n\n                    ``1998 Amendment:'' Subparagraphs a, b, c and f \n                were amended to implement the amendment to 10 U.S.C. \n                Sec. 895 (Article 95, UCMJ) contained in section 1112 \n                of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n                Year 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-106, 110 Stat. 186, 461 \n                (1996). The amendment proscribes fleeing from \n                apprehension without regard to whether the accused \n                otherwise resisted apprehension. The amendment responds \n                to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces \n                decisions in United States v. Harris, 29 M.J. 169 \n                (C.M.A. 1989), and United States v. Burgess, 32 M.J. \n                446 (C.M.A. 1991). In both cases, the court held that \n                resisting apprehension does not include fleeing from \n                apprehension, contrary to the then-existing explanation \n                in Part IV, paragraph 19c.(1)(c), MCM, of the nature of \n                the resistance required for resisting apprehension. The \n                1951 and 1969 Manuals for Courts-Martial also explained \n                that flight could constitute resisting apprehension \n                under Article 95, an interpretation affirmed in the \n                only early military case on point, United States v. \n                Mercer, 11 C.M.R. 812 (A.F.B.R. 1953). Flight from \n                apprehension should be expressly deterred and punished \n                under military law. Military personnel are specially \n                trained and routinely expected to submit to lawful \n                authority. Rather than being a merely incidental or \n                reflexive action, flight from apprehension in the \n                context of the armed forces may have a distinct and \n                cognizable impact on military discipline.''\n\n                b. Article 120--Rape and carnal knowledge. The \n                following analysis is inserted after the analysis to \n                Article 120:\n\n                    ``1998 Amendment:'' In enacting section 1113 of the \n                National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n                1996, Pub. L. No. 104-106, 110 Stat. 186, 462 (1996), \n                Congress amended Article 120, UCMJ, to make the offense \n                gender neutral and create a mistake of fact as to age \n                defense to a prosecution for carnal knowledge. The \n                accused must prove by a preponderance of the evidence \n                that the person with whom he or she had sexual \n                intercourse was at least 12 years of age, and that the \n                accused reasonably believed that this person was at \n                least 16 years of age.''\n\n                c. Article 128--Assault. The following analysis is \n                inserted after the analysis to Article 128, para. e:\n\n                    ``1998 Amendment:'' A separate maximum punishment \n                for assault with an unloaded firearm was created due to \n                the serious nature of the offense. Threatening a person \n                with an unloaded firearm places the victim of that \n                assault in fear of losing his or her life. Such a \n                traumatic experience is a far greater injury to the \n                victim than that sustained in the course of a typical \n                simple assault. Therefore, it calls for an increased \n                punishment.''\n\n                d. Article 134--(Parole, Violation of). The following \n                new analysis paragraph is inserted after paragraph 97:\n\n                ``97a. Article 134--(Parole, Violation of)\n\n                    1998 Amendment: The addition of paragraph 97a to \n                Part IV, Punitive Articles, makes clear that violation \n                of parole is an offense under Article 134, UCMJ. Both \n                the 1951 and 1969 Manuals for Courts-Martial listed the \n                offense in their respective Table of Maximum \n                Punishments. No explanatory guidance, however, was \n                contained in the discussion of Article 134, UCMJ in the \n                Manual for Courts-Martial. The drafters added paragraph \n                97a to ensure that an explanation of the offense, to \n                include its elements and a sample\n\n[[Page 30095]]\n\n                specification, is contained in the Manual for Courts-\n                Martial, Part IV, Punitive Articles.

Policy. Migratory birds are of great \n                ecological and economic value to this country and to \n                other countries. They contribute to biological \n                diversity and bring tremendous enjoyment to millions of \n                Americans who study, watch, feed, or hunt these birds \n                throughout the United States and other countries. The \n                United States has recognized the critical importance of \n                this shared resource by ratifying international, \n                bilateral conventions for the conservation of migratory \n                birds. Such conventions include the Convention for the \n                Protection of Migratory Birds with Great Britain on \n                behalf of Canada 1916, the Convention for the \n                Protection of Migratory Birds and Game Mammals-Mexico \n                1936, the Convention for the Protection of Birds and \n                Their Environment- Japan 1972, and the Convention for \n                the Conservation of Migratory Birds and Their \n                Environment-Union of Soviet Socialist Republics 1978.\n\n                These migratory bird conventions impose substantive \n                obligations on the United States for the conservation \n                of migratory birds and their habitats, and through the \n                Migratory Bird Treaty Act (Act), the United States has \n                implemented these migratory bird conventions with \n                respect to the United States. This Executive Order \n                directs executive departments and agencies to take \n                certain actions to further implement the Act.\n\n                Sec. 2. Definitions. For purposes of this order:\n\n                    (a) ``Take'' means take as defined in 50 C.F.R. \n                10.12, and includes both ``intentional'' and \n                ``unintentional'' take.\n                    (b) ``Intentional take'' means take that is the \n                purpose of the activity in question.\n                    (c) ``Unintentional take'' means take that results \n                from, but is not the purpose of, the activity in \n                question.\n                    (d) ``Migratory bird'' means any bird listed in 50 \n                C.F.R. 10.13.\n                    (e) ``Migratory bird resources'' means migratory \n                birds and the habitats upon which they depend.\n                    (f) ``Migratory bird convention'' means, \n                collectively, the bilateral conventions (with Great \n                Britain/Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Russia) for the \n                conservation of migratory bird resources.\n                    (g) ``Federal agency'' means an executive \n                department or agency, but does not include independent \n                establishments as defined by 5 U.S.C. 104.\n                    (h) ``Action'' means a program, activity, project, \n                official policy (such as a rule or regulation), or \n                formal plan directly carried out by a Federal agency. \n                Each Federal agency will further define what the term \n                ``action'' means with respect to its own authorities \n                and what programs should be included\n\n[[Page 3854]]\n\n                in the agency-specific Memoranda of Understanding \n                required by this order. Actions delegated to or assumed \n                by nonfederal entities, or carried out by nonfederal \n                entities with Federal assistance, are not subject to \n                this order. Such actions, however, continue to be \n                subject to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.\n                    (i) ``Species of concern'' refers to those species \n                listed in the periodic report ``Migratory Nongame Birds \n                of Management Concern in the United States,'' priority \n                migratory bird species as documented by established \n                plans (such as Bird Conservation Regions in the North \n                American Bird Conservation Initiative or Partners in \n                Flight physiographic areas), and those species listed \n                in 50 C.F.R. 17.11.\n\n                Sec. 3. Federal Agency Responsibilities. (a) Each \n                Federal agency taking actions that have, or are likely \n                to have, a measurable negative effect on migratory bird \n                populations is directed to develop and implement, \n                within 2 years, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) \n                with the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) that shall \n                promote the conservation of migratory bird populations.\n\n                    (b) In coordination with affected Federal agencies, \n                the Service shall develop a schedule for completion of \n                the MOUs within 180 days of the date of this order. The \n                schedule shall give priority to completing the MOUs \n                with agencies having the most substantive impacts on \n                migratory birds.\n                    (c) Each MOU shall establish protocols for \n                implementation of the MOU and for reporting \n                accomplishments. These protocols may be incorporated \n                into existing actions; however, the MOU shall recognize \n                that the agency may not be able to implement some \n                elements of the MOU until such time as the agency has \n                successfully included them in each agency's formal \n                planning processes (such as revision of agency land \n                management plans, land use compatibility guidelines, \n                integrated resource management plans, and fishery \n                management plans), including public participation and \n                NEPA analysis, as appropriate. This order and the MOUs \n                to be developed by the agencies are intended to be \n                implemented when new actions or renewal of contracts, \n                permits, delegations, or other third party agreements \n                are initiated as well as during the initiation of new, \n                or revisions to, land management plans.\n                    (d) Each MOU shall include an elevation process to \n                resolve any dispute between the signatory agencies \n                regarding a particular practice or activity.\n                    (e) Pursuant to its MOU, each agency shall, to the \n                extent permitted by law and subject to the availability \n                of appropriations and within Administration budgetary \n                limits, and in harmony with agency missions:\n                    (1) support the conservation intent of the \n                migratory bird conventions by integrating bird \n                conservation principles, measures, and practices into \n                agency activities and by avoiding or minimizing, to the \n                extent practicable, adverse impacts on migratory bird \n                resources when conducting agency actions;\n                    (2) restore and enhance the habitat of migratory \n                birds, as practicable;\n                    (3) prevent or abate the pollution or detrimental \n                alteration of the environment for the benefit of \n                migratory birds, as practicable;\n                    (4) design migratory bird habitat and population \n                conservation principles, measures, and practices, into \n                agency plans and planning processes (natural resource, \n                land management, and environmental quality planning, \n                including, but not limited to, forest and rangeland \n                planning, coastal management planning, watershed \n                planning, etc.) as practicable, and coordinate with \n                other agencies and nonfederal partners in planning \n                efforts;\n                    (5) within established authorities and in \n                conjunction with the adoption, amendment, or revision \n                of agency management plans and guidance, ensure that \n                agency plans and actions promote programs and \n                recommendations of comprehensive migratory bird \n                planning efforts such as Partners-in-Flight, U.S. \n                National Shorebird Plan, North American Waterfowl \n                Management Plan, North American Colonial Waterbird \n                Plan, and other planning efforts, as well as guidance \n                from other sources, including the Food and Agricultural\n\n[[Page 3855]]\n\n                Organization's International Plan of Action for \n                Reducing Incidental Catch of Seabirds in Longline \n                Fisheries;\n                    (6) ensure that environmental analyses of Federal \n                actions required by the NEPA or other established \n                environmental review processes evaluate the effects of \n                actions and agency plans on migratory birds, with \n                emphasis on species of concern;\n                    (7) provide notice to the Service in advance of \n                conducting an action that is intended to take migratory \n                birds, or annually report to the Service on the number \n                of individuals of each species of migratory birds \n                intentionally taken during the conduct of any agency \n                action, including but not limited to banding or \n                marking, scientific collecting, taxidermy, and \n                depredation control;\n                    (8) minimize the intentional take of species of \n                concern by: (i) delineating standards and procedures \n                for such take; and (ii) developing procedures for the \n                review and evaluation of take actions. With respect to \n                intentional take, the MOU shall be consistent with the \n                appropriate sections of 50 C.F.R. parts 10, 21, and 22;\n                    (9) identify where unintentional take reasonably \n                attributable to agency actions is having, or is likely \n                to have, a measurable negative effect on migratory bird \n                populations, focusing first on species of concern, \n                priority habitats, and key risk factors. With respect \n                to those actions so identified, the agency shall \n                develop and use principles, standards, and practices \n                that will lessen the amount of unintentional take, \n                developing any such conservation efforts in cooperation \n                with the Service. These principles, standards, and \n                practices shall be regularly evaluated and revised to \n                ensure that they are effective in lessening the \n                detrimental effect of agency actions on migratory bird \n                populations. The agency also shall inventory and \n                monitor bird habitat and populations within the \n                agency's capabilities and authorities to the extent \n                feasible to facilitate decisions about the need for, \n                and effectiveness of, conservation efforts;\n                    (10) within the scope of its statutorily-designated \n                authorities, control the import, export, and \n                establishment in the wild of live exotic animals and \n                plants that may be harmful to migratory bird resources;\n                    (11) promote research and information exchange \n                related to the conservation of migratory bird \n                resources, including coordinated inventorying and \n                monitoring and the collection and assessment of \n                information on environmental contaminants and other \n                physical or biological stressors having potential \n                relevance to migratory bird conservation. Where such \n                information is collected in the course of agency \n                actions or supported through Federal financial \n                assistance, reasonable efforts shall be made to share \n                such information with the Service, the Biological \n                Resources Division of the U.S. Geological Survey, and \n                other appropriate repositories of such data (e.g, the \n                Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology);\n                    (12) provide training and information to \n                appropriate employees on methods and means of avoiding \n                or minimizing the take of migratory birds and \n                conserving and restoring migratory bird habitat;\n                    (13) promote migratory bird conservation in \n                international activities and with other countries and \n                international partners, in consultation with the \n                Department of State, as appropriate or relevant to the \n                agency's authorities;\n                    (14) recognize and promote economic and \n                recreational values of birds, as appropriate; and\n                    (15) develop partnerships with non-Federal entities \n                to further bird conservation.\n                    (f) Notwithstanding the requirement to finalize an \n                MOU within 2 years, each agency is encouraged to \n                immediately begin implementing the conservation \n                measures set forth above in subparagraphs (1) through \n                (15) of this section, as appropriate and practicable.\n\n[[Page 3856]]\n\n                    (g) Each agency shall advise the public of the \n                availability of its MOU through a notice published in \n                the Federal Register.\n\n                Sec. 4. Council for the Conservation of Migratory \n                Birds. (a) The Secretary of Interior shall establish an \n                interagency Council for the Conservation of Migratory \n                Birds (Council) to oversee the implementation of this \n                order.

Preamble. On December 4, 2000, I issued \n                Executive Order 13178 establishing the Northwestern \n                Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve (Reserve) \n                pursuant to my authority under the National Marine \n                Sanctuaries Act, as amended by the National Marine \n                Sanctuary Amendments Act of 2000 (Act). In establishing \n                the Reserve, I set forth a number of conservation \n                measures and created specific Reserve Preservation \n                Areas to protect the coral reef ecosystem and related \n                marine resources and species (resources) of the \n                Reserve. The Act provides that no closure areas can \n                become permanent without adequate notice and comment. \n                Accordingly, I proposed to make permanent the Reserve \n                Preservation Areas and initiated a 30-day comment \n                period on this proposal. I also sought comment on the \n                conservation measures for the Reserve. On my behalf, \n                the Secretary of Commerce received the public comments \n                and held seven public hearings,including six throughout \n                Hawaii. After considering the comments expressed at the \n                hearings and received in writing, I have determined to \n                make permanent the Reserve Preservation Areas with \n                certain modifications set forth below. Further, I have \n                modified certain conservation measures to address \n                concerns raised, particularly regarding commercial and \n                recreational fishing within the Reserve. With this \n                action, the establishment of the Reserve under the Act, \n                including the conservation measures and permanent \n                Reserve Preservation Areas, is complete. The Secretary \n                of Commerce will manage the Reserve pursuant to \n                Executive Order 13178, as modified by this order, under \n                the Act. The Secretary shall also initiate the process \n                to designate the Reserve as a National Marine \n                Sanctuary, as required by the Act.\n\n                Sec. 2. Purpose. The purpose of this order is to amend \n                Executive Order 13178, and to make permanent Reserve \n                Preservation Areas, as modified below, to ensure the \n                comprehensive, strong, and lasting protection of the \n                resources of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.\n\n                Sec. 3. Amendments to Sections 7 of Executive Order \n                13178.\n\n                1. Section 7(a)(1) of Executive Order 13178 is hereby \n                amended by revising the first sentence to read as \n                follows:\n\n                ``Commercial Fishing.

NBAC also may identify other bioethical issues \n                for the purpose of providing advice and \n                recommendations, subject to the approval of the \n                National Science and Technology Council.\n\n                Sec. 5. Priorities. (a) As a first priority, NBAC shall \n                direct its attention to consideration of: protection of \n                the rights and welfare of human research subjects; and \n                issues in the management and use of genetic \n                information, including but not limited to, human gene \n                patenting.\n\n                (b) NBAC shall consider four criteria in establishing \n                the other priorities for its activities:\n\n                    (1) the public health or public policy urgency of \n                the bioethical issue;\n                    (2) the relation of the bioethical issue to the \n                goals for Federal investment in science and technology;\n                    (3) the absence of another entity able to \n                deliberate appropriately on the bioethical issue; and\n                    (4) the extent of interest in the issue within the \n                Federal Government.\n\n                Sec. 6. Administration. (a) The heads of executive \n                departments and agencies shall, to the extent permitted \n                by law, provide NBAC with such information as it may \n                require for purposes of carrying out its functions.\n\n                (b) NBAC may conduct inquiries, hold hearings, and \n                establish subcommittees, as necessary. The Assistant to \n                the President for Science and Technology and the \n                Secretary of Health and Human Services shall be \n                notified upon establishment of each subcommittee, and \n                shall be provided information on the name, membership \n                (including chair), function, estimated duration, and \n                estimated frequency of meetings of the subcommittee.\n\n                (c) NBAC is authorized to conduct analyses and develop \n                reports or other materials. In order to augment the \n                expertise present on NBAC, the Secretary of Health and \n                Human Services may contract for the services of \n                nongovernmental consultants who may conduct analyses, \n                prepare reports and background papers, or prepare other \n                materials for consideration by NBAC, as appropriate.\n\n                (d) Members of NBAC shall be compensated in accordance \n                with Federal law. Members of NBAC may be allowed travel \n                expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, to \n                the extent permitted by law for persons serving \n                intermittently in the government service (5 U.S.C. \n                5701-5707).\n\n                (e) To the extent permitted by law, and subject to the \n                availability of appropriations, the Department of \n                Health and Human Services shall provide NBAC with such \n                funds as may be necessary for the performance of its \n                functions. The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n                shall provide management and support services to NBAC.\n\n                Sec. 7. General Provisions. (a) Notwithstanding the \n                provisions of any other Executive order, the functions \n                of the President under the Federal Advisory Committee \n                Act that are applicable to NBAC, except that of \n                reporting annually to the Congress, shall be performed \n                by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in \n                accordance with the guidelines and procedures \n                established by the Administrator of General Services.\n\n                (b) NBAC shall terminate two years from the date of \n                this order unless extended prior to that date. \n\n[[Page 52065]]\n\n\n                (c) This order is intended only to improve the internal \n                management of the executive branch and it is not \n                intended to create any right, benefit, trust, or \n                responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable \n                at law or equity by a party against the United States, \n                its agencies, its officers, or any person.\n\n                    (Presidential Sig.)<clinton1><clinton2>\n\n                THE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n                    October 3, 1995.\n\n[FR Doc. 95-24921\nFiled 10-3-95; 2:11 pm]\nBilling code 3195-01-P\n\n</clinton2></clinton1></pre>]","url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/1995/10/05/95-24921/protection-of-human-research-subjects-and-creation-of-national-bioethics-advisory-commission","president":"clinton","id":"12975"},"reftime":1418257583306}

BUSH, President of the United States of \n                America, take note that in Executive Order 13194, the \n                President responded to, among other things, the \n                insurgent Revolutionary United Front's (RUF) illicit \n                trade in diamonds to fund its operations in the civil \n                war in Sierra Leone by declaring a national emergency \n                and, consistent with United Nations Security Council \n                Resolution 1306, by prohibiting the importation into \n                the United States of all rough diamonds from Sierra \n                Leone except for those importations controlled through \n                the Certificate of Origin regime of the Government of \n                Sierra Leone. United Nations Security Council \n                Resolution 1343 takes note that the bulk of RUF \n                diamonds leaves Sierra Leone through Liberia and that \n                such illicit trade cannot be conducted without the \n                permission and involvement of Liberian government \n                officials at the highest levels; determines that the \n                active support provided by the Government of Liberia \n                for the RUF and other armed rebel groups in neighboring \n                countries constitutes a threat to international peace \n                and security in the region; and decides that all states \n                shall take the necessary measures to prevent the \n                importation of all rough diamonds from Liberia, whether \n                or not such diamonds originated in Liberia. The \n                Government of Liberia's complicity in the RUF's illicit \n                trade in diamonds and its other forms of support for \n                the RUF are direct challenges to United States foreign \n                policy objectives in the region as well as to the rule-\n                based international order that is crucial to the peace \n                and prosperity of the United States. Therefore, I find \n                these actions by the Government of Liberia contribute \n                to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign \n                policy of the United States described in Executive \n                Order 13194 with respect to which the President \n                declared a national emergency. In order to deal with \n                that threat and to ensure further that the direct or \n                indirect importation into the United States of rough \n                diamonds from Sierra Leone will not contribute \n                financial support to further aggressive actions by the \n                RUF or to the RUF's procurement of weapons; to \n                implement United Nations Security Council Resolution \n                1343; and to counteract, among other things, the \n                Government of Liberia's facilitation of and \n                participation in the RUF's illicit trade in diamonds \n                through Liberia, I hereby order the following \n                additional measures be taken with respect to \n                prohibiting the importation of rough diamonds from \n                Sierra Leone:\n\n                Section 1.

Any transaction by a United States person or \n                within the United States that evades or avoids, or has \n                the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to \n                violate, any of the prohibitions set forth in this \n                order is prohibited.

Background and Policy. The District of \n                Columbia is the Nation's Capital, and the Federal \n                Government is the largest employer, landholder, and \n                purchaser in the region. The Executive Office of the \n                President has established and maintained an interest in \n                fostering the Federal relationship with the District of \n                Columbia since 1963. This Administration has long \n                sought to strengthen the relationship between the \n                Federal Government and the District of Columbia by \n                initiating a historic restructuring of this \n                relationship. At the request of the President, in 1995, \n                the Federal D.C. Interagency Task Force, chaired by the \n                Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and \n                directed by the Special Advisor to the President and \n                Executive Director of the Federal D.C. Interagency Task \n                Force, was created to revitalize the District of \n                Columbia and improve prospects for ``home rule'' to \n                succeed in the Nation's Capital. The Federal D.C. \n                Interagency Task Force Office has worked with Federal \n                agencies, the Congress, and local officials to promote \n                long-term financial stability, economic growth, and \n                opportunity for self-government for the District of \n                Columbia. In 1997, the President signed into law the \n                National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government \n                Improvement Act of 1997, under which the Federal \n                Government undertook certain responsibilities and \n                governmental functions befitting a State or county \n                government. Also in 1997, the President signed into law \n                tax incentives designed to spur economic growth in the \n                District of Columbia.\n\n                It is the policy of this Administration, therefore, to \n                build on the momentum of the accomplishments over the \n                last 5 years by formally establishing the Federal D.C. \n                Interagency Task Force to further assist the District \n                of Columbia in achieving financial stability, economic \n                growth, and improvement in management and service \n                delivery.\n\n                Sec. 2. Establishment of the Federal Interagency Task \n                Force on the District of Columbia.\n\n                    (a) There is established the ``Federal Interagency \n                Task Force on the District of Columbia'' (Task Force).\n                    (b) The Task Force shall be composed of the \n                following members:\n\n (1) The Attorney General;\n\n (2) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development;\n\n (3) The Secretary of Health and Human Services;\n\n (4) The Secretary of Labor;\n\n (5) The Secretary of Transportation;\n\n (6) The Secretary of the Treasury;\n\n (7) The Administrator of General Services;\n\n (8) The Secretary of Education;\n\n (9) The Secretary of the Interior;\n\n (10) The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency;\n\n[[Page 5422]]\n\n (11) The Secretary of Commerce;\n\n (12) The Secretary of Agriculture;\n\n (13) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget;\n\n (14) The Administrator of the Small Business Administration;\n\n (15) The Commissioner of the Social Security;\n\n (16) The Secretary of Energy;\n\n (17) The Director of the Office of Personnel Management; and\n\n (18) Such other members as the Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget may provide (including the Director of the Court Services and \nOffender Supervision Agency, which office is located in the Department of \nJustice.)\n\n                    (c) The Task Force shall be chaired by the Director \n                of the Office of Management and Budget (Director).

Purpose. The purpose of the Interagency Task \n                Force will be to coordinate and better leverage \n                Administration efforts and initiatives for the District \n                of Columbia in concert with local and regional \n                initiatives to improve the long-term financial \n                stability of the Nation's Capital and to improve self-\n                governance. The Director's designee shall serve as \n                liaison between the executive branch and the executive, \n                legislative, and judicial branches of government of the \n                District of Columbia, as well as the private sector.\n\n                Sec. 4.

Upon conclusion of \n                a trade agreement that includes provisions specifically \n                addressing tobacco or tobacco products, the USTR shall \n                produce and make publicly available a summary \n                describing those provisions.\n                    (c) International Tobacco Control Needs Assessment. \n                The HHS, with the cooperation of the Departments of \n                State, Commerce, and Agriculture, and in consultation \n                with the appropriate national Ministry of Health, shall \n                conduct a pilot assessment of tobacco use in a country \n                other than the United States. Such assessment will be \n                carried out through a compilation and review of surveys \n                and other needs assessments already available and \n                include:\n                    (1) initial estimates of the burden of disease and \n                other public health consequences of tobacco use;\n                    (2) the status of tobacco control regulatory \n                measures in place to curtail tobacco consumption and \n                tobacco related disease; and\n                    (3) an analysis of the marketing, distribution, and \n                manufacturing practices of tobacco companies in given \n                regions, and the impact of those practices\n\n[[Page 7388]]\n\n                on smoking rates, particularly among women and \n                children. Such assessment shall be prepared and \n                provided to interested agencies and other parties not \n                later than December 31, 2001, and be updated as \n                practicable.\n                    (d) Research and Training in Tobacco Control.

(a) Information may \n                be originally classified under the terms of this order \n                only if all of the following conditions are met:\n\n(1) an original classification authority is classifying the information;\n\n(2) the information is owned by, produced by or for, or is under the \ncontrol of the United States Government;\n\n(3) the information falls within one or more of the categories of \ninformation listed in section 1.4 of this order; and\n\n(4) the original classification authority determines that the unauthorized \ndisclosure of the information reasonably could be expected to result in \ndamage to the national security, which includes defense against \ntransnational terrorism, and the original classification authority is able \nto identify or describe the damage.\n\n                    (b) Classified information shall not be \n                declassified automatically as a result of any \n                unauthorized disclosure of identical or similar \n                information.\n                    (c) The unauthorized disclosure of foreign \n                government information is presumed to cause damage to \n                the national security.\n\n                Sec. 1.2. Classification Levels. (a) Information may be \n                classified at one of the following three levels:\n\n(1) ``Top Secret'' shall be applied to information, the unauthorized \ndisclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally \ngrave damage to the national security that the original classification \nauthority is able to identify or describe.\n\n(2) ``Secret'' shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure \nof which reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the\n\n[[Page 15316]]\n\nnational security that the original classification authority is able to \nidentify or describe.\n\n(3) ``Confidential'' shall be applied to information, the unauthorized \ndisclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the \nnational security that the original classification authority is able to \nidentify or describe.\n\n                    (b) Except as otherwise provided by statute, no \n                other terms shall be used to identify United States \n                classified information.\n\n                Sec. 1.3. Classification Authority. (a) The authority \n                to classify information originally may be exercised \n                only by:\n\n(1) the President and, in the performance of executive duties, the Vice \nPresident;\n\n(2) agency heads and officials designated by the President in the Federal \nRegister; and\n\n(3) United States Government officials delegated this authority pursuant to \nparagraph (c) of this section.\n\n                    (b) Officials authorized to classify information at \n                a specified level are also authorized to classify \n                information at a lower level.\n                    (c) Delegation of original classification \n                authority.\n\n(1) Delegations of original classification authority shall be limited to \nthe minimum required to administer this order. Agency heads are responsible \nfor ensuring that designated subordinate officials have a demonstrable and \ncontinuing need to exercise this authority.\n\n(2) ``Top Secret'' original classification authority may be delegated only \nby the President; in the performance of executive duties, the Vice \nPresident; or an agency head or official designated pursuant to paragraph \n(a)(2) of this section.\n\n(3) ``Secret'' or ``Confidential'' original classification authority may be \ndelegated only by the President; in the performance of executive duties, \nthe Vice President; or an agency head or official designated pursuant to \nparagraph (a)(2) of this section; or the senior agency official described \nin section 5.4(d) of this order, provided that official has been delegated \n``Top Secret'' original classification authority by the agency head.\n\n(4) Each delegation of original classification authority shall be in \nwriting and the authority shall not be redelegated except as provided in \nthis order. Each delegation shall identify the official by name or position \ntitle.\n\n                    (d) Original classification authorities must \n                receive training in original classification as provided \n                in this order and its implementing directives. Such \n                training must include instruction on the proper \n                safeguarding of classified information and of the \n                criminal, civil, and administrative sanctions that may \n                be brought against an individual who fails to protect \n                classified information from unauthorized disclosure.\n                    (e) Exceptional cases. When an employee, government \n                contractor, licensee, certificate holder, or grantee of \n                an agency who does not have original classification \n                authority originates information believed by that \n                person to require classification, the information shall \n                be protected in a manner consistent with this order and \n                its implementing directives. The information shall be \n                transmitted promptly as provided under this order or \n                its implementing directives to the agency that has \n                appropriate subject matter interest and classification \n                authority with respect to this information. That agency \n                shall decide within 30 days whether to classify this \n                information. If it is not clear which agency has \n                classification responsibility for this information, it \n                shall be sent to the Director of the Information \n                Security Oversight Office. The Director shall determine \n                the agency having primary subject matter interest and \n                forward the information, with appropriate \n                recommendations, to that agency for a classification \n                determination.\n\n[[Page 15317]]\n\n                Sec. 1.4. Classification Categories. Information shall \n                not be considered for classification unless it \n                concerns:\n\n                    (a) military plans, weapons systems, or operations;\n                    (b) foreign government information;\n                    (c) intelligence activities (including special \n                activities), intelligence sources or methods, or \n                cryptology;\n                    (d) foreign relations or foreign activities of the \n                United States, including confidential sources;\n                    (e) scientific, technological, or economic matters \n                relating to the national security, which includes \n                defense against transnational terrorism;\n                    (f) United States Government programs for \n                safeguarding nuclear materials or facilities;\n                    (g) vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, \n                installations, infrastructures, projects, plans, or \n                protection services relating to the national security, \n                which includes defense against transnational terrorism; \n                or\n                    (h) weapons of mass destruction.\n\n                Sec. 1.5. Duration of Classification. (a) At the time \n                of original classification, the original classification \n                authority shall attempt to establish a specific date or \n                event for declassification based upon the duration of \n                the national security sensitivity of the information. \n                Upon reaching the date or event, the information shall \n                be automatically declassified. The date or event shall \n                not exceed the time frame established in paragraph (b) \n                of this section.\n\n                    (b) If the original classification authority cannot \n                determine an earlier specific date or event for \n                declassification, information shall be marked for \n                declassification 10 years from the date of the original \n                decision, unless the original classification authority \n                otherwise determines that the sensitivity of the \n                information requires that it shall be marked for \n                declassification for up to 25 years from the date of \n                the original decision. All information classified under \n                this section shall be subject to section 3.3 of this \n                order if it is contained in records of permanent \n                historical value under title 44, United States Code.\n                    (c) An original classification authority may extend \n                the duration of classification, change the level of \n                classification, or reclassify specific information only \n                when the standards and procedures for classifying \n                information under this order are followed.\n                    (d) Information marked for an indefinite duration \n                of classification under predecessor orders, for \n                example, marked as ``Originating Agency's Determination \n                Required,'' or information classified under predecessor \n                orders that contains no declassification instructions \n                shall be declassified in accordance with part 3 of this \n                order.\n\n                Sec. 1.6. Identification and Markings. (a) At the time \n                of original classification, the following shall appear \n                on the face of each classified document, or shall be \n                applied to other classified media in an appropriate \n                manner:\n\n(1) one of the three classification levels defined in section 1.2 of this \norder;\n\n(2) the identity, by name or personal identifier and position, of the \noriginal classification authority;\n\n(3) the agency and office of origin, if not otherwise evident;\n\n(4) declassification instructions, which shall indicate one of the \nfollowing:\n\n(A)\n\n the date or event for declassification, as prescribed in section 1.5(a) or \nsection 1.5(c);\n\n(B)\n\n the date that is 10 years from the date of original classification, as \nprescribed in section 1.5(b); or\n\n(C)\n\n the date that is up to 25 years from the date of original classification, \nas prescribed in section 1.5 (b); and\n\n(5) a concise reason for classification that, at a minimum, cites the \napplicable classification categories in section 1.4 of this order.\n\n[[Page 15318]]\n\n                    (b) Specific information described in paragraph (a) \n                of this section may be excluded if it would reveal \n                additional classified information.\n                    (c) With respect to each classified document, the \n                agency originating the document shall, by marking or \n                other means, indicate which portions are classified, \n                with the applicable classification level, and which \n                portions are unclassified. In accordance with standards \n                prescribed in directives issued under this order, the \n                Director of the Information Security Oversight Office \n                may grant waivers of this requirement. The Director \n                shall revoke any waiver upon a finding of abuse.\n                    (d) Markings implementing the provisions of this \n                order, including abbreviations and requirements to \n                safeguard classified working papers, shall conform to \n                the standards prescribed in implementing directives \n                issued pursuant to this order.\n                    (e) Foreign government information shall retain its \n                original classification markings or shall be assigned a \n                U.S. classification that provides a degree of \n                protection at least equivalent to that required by the \n                entity that furnished the information. Foreign \n                government information retaining its original \n                classification markings need not be assigned a U.S. \n                classification marking provided that the responsible \n                agency determines that the foreign government markings \n                are adequate to meet the purposes served by U.S. \n                classification markings.\n                    (f) Information assigned a level of classification \n                under this or predecessor orders shall be considered as \n                classified at that level of classification despite the \n                omission of other required markings. Whenever such \n                information is used in the derivative classification \n                process or is reviewed for possible declassification, \n                holders of such information shall coordinate with an \n                appropriate classification authority for the \n                application of omitted markings.\n                    (g) The classification authority shall, whenever \n                practicable, use a classified addendum whenever \n                classified information constitutes a small portion of \n                an otherwise unclassified document.\n                    (h) Prior to public release, all declassified \n                records shall be appropriately marked to reflect their \n                declassification.\n\n                Sec. 1.7. Classification Prohibitions and Limitations.\n\n                    (a) In no case shall information be classified in \n                order to:\n\n(1) conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error;\n\n(2) prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency;\n\n(3) restrain competition; or\n\n(4) prevent or delay the release of information that does not require \nprotection in the interest of the national security.\n\n                    (b) Basic scientific research information not \n                clearly related to the national security shall not be \n                classified.\n                    (c) Information may be reclassified after \n                declassification and release to the public under proper \n                authority only in accordance with the following \n                conditions:\n\n(1) the reclassification action is taken under the personal authority of \nthe agency head or deputy agency head, who determines in writing that the \nreclassification of the information is necessary in the interest of the \nnational security;\n\n(2) the information may be reasonably recovered; and\n\n(3) the reclassification action is reported promptly to the Director of the \nInformation Security Oversight Office.\n\n                    (d) Information that has not previously been \n                disclosed to the public under proper authority may be \n                classified or reclassified after an agency has received \n                a request for it under the Freedom of Information Act \n                (5 U.S.C. 552) or the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. \n                552a), or the mandatory review provisions of section \n                3.5 of this order only if such classification meets the \n                requirements of this order and is accomplished on a \n                document-by-document basis with\n\n[[Page 15319]]\n\n                the personal participation or under the direction of \n                the agency head, the deputy agency head, or the senior \n                agency official designated under section 5.4 of this \n                order.\n                    (e) Compilations of items of information that are \n                individually unclassified may be classified if the \n                compiled information reveals an additional association \n                or relationship that: (1) meets the standards for \n                classification under this order; and (2) is not \n                otherwise revealed in the individual items of \n                information. As used in this order, ``compilation'' \n                means an aggregation of pre-existing unclassified items \n                of information.\n\n                Sec. 1.8. Classification Challenges. (a) Authorized \n                holders of information who, in good faith, believe that \n                its classification status is improper are encouraged \n                and expected to challenge the classification status of \n                the information in accordance with agency procedures \n                established under paragraph (b) of this section.\n\n                    (b) In accordance with implementing directives \n                issued pursuant to this order, an agency head or senior \n                agency official shall establish procedures under which \n                authorized holders of information are encouraged and \n                expected to challenge the classification of information \n                that they believe is improperly classified or \n                unclassified. These procedures shall ensure that:\n\n(1) individuals are not subject to retribution for bringing such actions;\n\n(2) an opportunity is provided for review by an impartial official or \npanel; and\n\n(3) individuals are advised of their right to appeal agency decisions to \nthe Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel (Panel) established \nby section 5.3 of this order.\n\n                PART 2--DERIVATIVE CLASSIFICATION\n\n                Sec. 2.1. Use of Derivative Classification. (a) Persons \n                who only reproduce, extract, or summarize classified \n                information, or who only apply classification markings \n                derived from source material or as directed by a \n                classification guide, need not possess original \n                classification authority.\n\n                    (b) Persons who apply derivative classification \n                markings shall:\n\n(1) observe and respect original classification decisions; and\n\n(2) carry forward to any newly created documents the pertinent \nclassification markings. For information derivatively classified based on \nmultiple sources, the derivative classifier shall carry forward:\n\n(A)\n\n the date or event for declassification that corresponds to the longest \nperiod of classification among the sources; and\n\n(B)\n\n a listing of these sources on or attached to the official file or record \ncopy.\n\n                Sec. 2.2. Classification Guides. (a) Agencies with \n                original classification authority shall prepare \n                classification guides to facilitate the proper and \n                uniform derivative classification of information. These \n                guides shall conform to standards contained in \n                directives issued under this order.\n\n                    (b) Each guide shall be approved personally and in \n                writing by an official who:\n\n(1) has program or supervisory responsibility over the information or is \nthe senior agency official; and\n\n(2) is authorized to classify information originally at the highest level \nof classification prescribed in the guide.\n\n                    (c) Agencies shall establish procedures to ensure \n                that classification guides are reviewed and updated as \n                provided in directives issued under this order.\n\n                PART 3--DECLASSIFICATION AND DOWNGRADING\n\n                Sec. 3.1. Authority for Declassification. (a) \n                Information shall be declassified as soon as it no \n                longer meets the standards for classification under \n                this order.\n\n[[Page 15320]]\n\n                    (b) It is presumed that information that continues \n                to meet the classification requirements under this \n                order requires continued protection. In some \n                exceptional cases, however, the need to protect such \n                information may be outweighed by the public interest in \n                disclosure of the information, and in these cases the \n                information should be declassified. When such questions \n                arise, they shall be referred to the agency head or the \n                senior agency official. That official will determine, \n                as an exercise of discretion, whether the public \n                interest in disclosure outweighs the damage to the \n                national security that might reasonably be expected \n                from disclosure. This provision does not:\n\n(1) amplify or modify the substantive criteria or procedures for \nclassification; or\n\n(2) create any substantive or procedural rights subject to judicial review.\n\n                    (c) If the Director of the Information Security \n                Oversight Office determines that information is \n                classified in violation of this order, the Director may \n                require the information to be declassified by the \n                agency that originated the classification. Any such \n                decision by the Director may be appealed to the \n                President through the Assistant to the President for \n                National Security Affairs. The information shall remain \n                classified pending a prompt decision on the appeal.\n                    (d) The provisions of this section shall also apply \n                to agencies that, under the terms of this order, do not \n                have original classification authority, but had such \n                authority under predecessor orders.\n\n                Sec. 3.2. Transferred Records. (a) In the case of \n                classified records transferred in conjunction with a \n                transfer of functions, and not merely for storage \n                purposes, the receiving agency shall be deemed to be \n                the originating agency for purposes of this order.\n\n                    (b) In the case of classified records that are not \n                officially transferred as described in paragraph (a) of \n                this section, but that originated in an agency that has \n                ceased to exist and for which there is no successor \n                agency, each agency in possession of such records shall \n                be deemed to be the originating agency for purposes of \n                this order. Such records may be declassified or \n                downgraded by the agency in possession after \n                consultation with any other agency that has an interest \n                in the subject matter of the records.\n                    (c) Classified records accessioned into the \n                National Archives and Records Administration (National \n                Archives) as of the effective date of this order shall \n                be declassified or downgraded by the Archivist of the \n                United States (Archivist) in accordance with this \n                order, the directives issued pursuant to this order, \n                agency declassification guides, and any existing \n                procedural agreement between the Archivist and the \n                relevant agency head.\n                    (d) The originating agency shall take all \n                reasonable steps to declassify classified information \n                contained in records determined to have permanent \n                historical value before they are accessioned into the \n                National Archives. However, the Archivist may require \n                that classified records be accessioned into the \n                National Archives when necessary to comply with the \n                provisions of the Federal Records Act. This provision \n                does not apply to records being transferred to the \n                Archivist pursuant to section 2203 of title 44, United \n                States Code, or records for which the National Archives \n                serves as the custodian of the records of an agency or \n                organization that has gone out of existence.\n                    (e) To the extent practicable, agencies shall adopt \n                a system of records management that will facilitate the \n                public release of documents at the time such documents \n                are declassified pursuant to the provisions for \n                automatic declassification in section 3.3 of this \n                order.\n\n                Sec. 3.3.

The notification shall include:\n\n(1) a description of the file series;\n\n(2) an explanation of why the information within the file series is almost \ninvariably exempt from automatic declassification and why the information \nmust remain classified for a longer period of time; and\n\n(3) except for the identity of a confidential human source or a human \nintelligence source, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a \nspecific date or event for declassification of the information. The \nPresident may direct the agency head not to exempt the file series or to \ndeclassify the information within that series at an earlier date than \nrecommended. File series exemptions previously approved by the President \nshall remain valid without any additional agency action.\n\n                    (d) At least 180 days before information is \n                automatically declassified under this section, an \n                agency head or senior agency official shall notify the \n                Director of the Information Security Oversight Office, \n                serving as Executive Secretary of the Panel, of any \n                specific information beyond that included in a \n                notification to the President under paragraph (c) of \n                this section that the agency proposes to exempt from \n                automatic declassification.

The Panel \nmay direct the agency not to exempt the information or to declassify it at \nan earlier date than recommended. The agency head may appeal such a \ndecision to the President through the Assistant to the President for \nNational Security Affairs. The information will remain classified while \nsuch an appeal is pending.\n\n                    (e) The following provisions shall apply to the \n                onset of automatic declassification:\n\n(1) Classified records within an integral file block, as defined in this \norder, that are otherwise subject to automatic declassification under this \nsection shall not be automatically declassified until December 31 of the \nyear that is 25 years from the date of the most recent record within the \nfile block.\n\n(2) By notification to the Director of the Information Security Oversight \nOffice, before the records are subject to automatic declassification, an \nagency head or senior agency official designated under section 5.4 of this \norder may delay automatic declassification for up to 5 additional years for \nclassified information contained in microforms, motion pictures, \naudiotapes, videotapes, or comparable media that make a review for possible \ndeclassification exemptions more difficult or costly.\n\n(3) By notification to the Director of the Information Security Oversight \nOffice, before the records are subject to automatic declassification, an \nagency head or senior agency official designated under section 5.4 of this \norder may delay automatic declassification for up to 3 years for classified \nrecords that have been referred or transferred to that agency by another \nagency less than 3 years before automatic declassification would otherwise \nbe required.\n\n(4) By notification to the Director of the Information Security Oversight \nOffice, an agency head or senior agency official designated under section \n5.4 of this order may delay automatic declassification for up to 3 years \nfrom the date of discovery of classified records that were inadvertently \nnot reviewed prior to the effective date of automatic declassification.\n\n                    (f) Information exempted from automatic \n                declassification under this section shall remain \n                subject to the mandatory and systematic \n                declassification review provisions of this order.\n                    (g) The Secretary of State shall determine when the \n                United States should commence negotiations with the \n                appropriate officials of a foreign government or \n                international organization of governments to modify any \n                treaty or international agreement that requires the \n                classification of information contained in records \n                affected by this section for a period longer than 25 \n                years from the date of its creation, unless the treaty \n                or international agreement pertains to information that \n                may otherwise remain classified beyond 25 years under \n                this section.\n                    (h) Records containing information that originated \n                with other agencies or the disclosure of which would \n                affect the interests or activities of other agencies \n                shall be referred for review to those agencies and the \n                information of concern shall be subject to automatic \n                declassification only by those agencies, consistent \n                with the provisions of subparagraphs (e)(3) and (e)(4) \n                of this section.\n\n                Sec. 3.4.

An official or employee leaving agency \n                service may not remove classified information from the \n                agency's control.\n\n[[Page 15325]]\n\n                    (d) Classified information may not be removed from \n                official premises without proper authorization.\n                    (e) Persons authorized to disseminate classified \n                information outside the executive branch shall ensure \n                the protection of the information in a manner \n                equivalent to that provided within the executive \n                branch.\n                    (f) Consistent with law, directives, and \n                regulation, an agency head or senior agency official \n                shall establish uniform procedures to ensure that \n                automated information systems, including networks and \n                telecommunications systems, that collect, create, \n                communicate, compute, disseminate, process, or store \n                classified information have controls that:\n\n(1) prevent access by unauthorized persons; and\n\n(2) ensure the integrity of the information.\n\n                    (g) Consistent with law, directives, and \n                regulation, each agency head or senior agency official \n                shall establish controls to ensure that classified \n                information is used, processed, stored, reproduced, \n                transmitted, and destroyed under conditions that \n                provide adequate protection and prevent access by \n                unauthorized persons.\n                    (h) Consistent with directives issued pursuant to \n                this order, an agency shall safeguard foreign \n                government information under standards that provide a \n                degree of protection at least equivalent to that \n                required by the government or international \n                organization of governments that furnished the \n                information. When adequate to achieve equivalency, \n                these standards may be less restrictive than the \n                safeguarding standards that ordinarily apply to United \n                States ``Confidential'' information, including modified \n                handling and transmission and allowing access to \n                individuals with a need-to-know who have not otherwise \n                been cleared for access to classified information or \n                executed an approved nondisclosure agreement.\n                    (i) Except as otherwise provided by statute, this \n                order, directives implementing this order, or by \n                direction of the President, classified information \n                originating in one agency shall not be disseminated \n                outside any other agency to which it has been made \n                available without the consent of the originating \n                agency. An agency head or senior agency official may \n                waive this requirement for specific information \n                originated within that agency. For purposes of this \n                section, the Department of Defense shall be considered \n                one agency.

Distribution Controls. (a) Each agency shall \n                establish controls over the distribution of classified \n                information to ensure that it is distributed only to \n                organizations or individuals eligible for access and \n                with a need-to-know the information.\n\n                    (b) In an emergency, when necessary to respond to \n                an imminent threat to life or in defense of the \n                homeland, the agency head or any designee may authorize \n                the disclosure of classified information to an \n                individual or individuals who are otherwise not \n                eligible for access. Such actions shall be taken only \n                in accordance with the directives implementing this \n                order and any procedures issued by agencies governing \n                the classified information, which shall be designed to \n                minimize the classified information that is disclosed \n                under these circumstances and the number of individuals \n                who receive it. Information disclosed under this \n                provision or implementing directives and procedures \n                shall not be deemed declassified as a result of such \n                disclosure or subsequent use by a recipient. Such \n                disclosures shall be reported promptly to the \n                originator of the classified information. For purposes \n                of this section, the Director of Central Intelligence \n                may issue an implementing directive governing the \n                emergency disclosure of classified intelligence \n                information.\n                    (c) Each agency shall update, at least annually, \n                the automatic, routine, or recurring distribution of \n                classified information that they distribute. Recipients \n                shall cooperate fully with distributors who are \n                updating distribution lists and shall notify \n                distributors whenever a relevant change in status \n                occurs.\n\n[[Page 15326]]\n\n                Sec. 4.3.

Unless otherwise authorized by \n                the President, only the Secretaries of State, Defense, \n                and Energy, and the Director of Central Intelligence, \n                or the principal deputy of each, may create a special \n                access program. For special access programs pertaining \n                to intelligence activities (including special \n                activities, but not including military operational, \n                strategic, and tactical programs), or intelligence \n                sources or methods, this function shall be exercised by \n                the Director of Central Intelligence. These officials \n                shall keep the number of these programs at an absolute \n                minimum, and shall establish them only when the program \n                is required by statute or upon a specific finding that:\n\n(1) the vulnerability of, or threat to, specific information is \nexceptional; and\n\n(2) the normal criteria for determining eligibility for access applicable \nto information classified at the same level are not deemed sufficient to \nprotect the information from unauthorized disclosure.\n\n                    (b) Requirements and limitations. (1) Special \n                access programs shall be limited to programs in which \n                the number of persons who will have access ordinarily \n                will be reasonably small and commensurate with the \n                objective of providing enhanced protection for the \n                information involved.\n\n(2) Each agency head shall establish and maintain a system of accounting \nfor special access programs consistent with directives issued pursuant to \nthis order.\n\n(3) Special access programs shall be subject to the oversight program \nestablished under section 5.4(d) of this order. In addition, the Director \nof the Information Security Oversight Office shall be afforded access to \nthese programs, in accordance with the security requirements of each \nprogram, in order to perform the functions assigned to the Information \nSecurity Oversight Office under this order. An agency head may limit access \nto a special access program to the Director and no more than one other \nemployee of the Information Security Oversight Office, or, for special \naccess programs that are extraordinarily sensitive and vulnerable, to the \nDirector only.\n\n(4) The agency head or principal deputy shall review annually each special \naccess program to determine whether it continues to meet the requirements \nof this order.\n\n(5) Upon request, an agency head shall brief the Assistant to the President \nfor National Security Affairs, or a designee, on any or all of the agency's \nspecial access programs.\n\n                    (c) Nothing in this order shall supersede any \n                requirement made by or under 10 U.S.C. 119.\n\n                Sec. 4.4.

If \n                an agency is unable\n\n[[Page 24596]]\n\n                to reduce the use of selected chemicals, that agency \n                will reduce the use of selected hazardous substances or \n                its generation of other pollutants, such as hazardous \n                and radioactive waste types, at its facilities by 50 \n                percent by December 31, 2006.\n\n                Sec. 206. Reductions in Ozone-Depleting Substances. \n                Through evaluating present and future uses of ozone-\n                depleting substances and maximizing the purchase and \n                the use of safe, cost effective, and environmentally \n                preferable alternatives, each agency shall develop a \n                plan to phase out the procurement of Class I ozone-\n                depleting substances for all nonexcepted uses by \n                December 31, 2010.\n\n                Sec. 207. Environmentally and Economically Beneficial \n                Landscaping. Each agency shall strive to promote the \n                sustainable management of Federal facility lands \n                through the implementation of cost-effective, \n                environmentally sound landscaping practices, and \n                programs to reduce adverse impacts to the natural \n                environment.\n\n                PART 3--PLANNING AND ACCOUNTABILITY\n\n                Sec. 301. Annual Budget Submission. Federal agencies \n                shall place high priority on obtaining funding and \n                resources needed for implementation of the Greening the \n                Government Executive Orders, including funding to \n                address findings and recommendations from environmental \n                management system audits or facility compliance audits \n                conducted under sections 401 and 402 of this order. \n                Federal agencies shall make such requests as required \n                in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-11.\n\n                Sec. 302. Application of Life Cycle Assessment \n                Concepts. Each agency with facilities shall establish a \n                pilot program to apply life cycle assessment and \n                environmental cost accounting principles. To the \n                maximum extent feasible and cost-effective, agencies \n                shall apply those principles elsewhere in the agency to \n                meet the goals and requirements of this order. Such \n                analysis shall be considered in the process established \n                in the OMB Capital Programming Guide and OMB Circular \n                A-11. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in \n                coordination with the Workgroup established in section \n                306 of this order, shall, to the extent feasible, \n                assist agencies in identifying, applying, and \n                developing tools that reflect life cycle assessment and \n                environmental cost accounting principles and provide \n                technical assistance to agencies in developing life \n                cycle assessments and environmental cost accounting \n                assessments under this Part.\n\n                Sec. 303. Pollution Prevention to Address Compliance. \n                Each agency shall ensure that its environmental \n                regulatory compliance funding policies promote the use \n                of pollution prevention to achieve and maintain \n                environmental compliance at the agency's facilities. \n                Agencies shall adopt a policy to preferentially use \n                pollution prevention projects and activities to correct \n                and prevent noncompliance with environmental regulatory \n                requirements. Agency funding requests for facility \n                compliance with Federal, State, and local environmental \n                regulatory requirements shall emphasize pollution \n                prevention through source reduction as the means of \n                first choice to ensure compliance, with reuse and \n                recycling alternatives having second priority as a \n                means of compliance.\n\n                Sec. 304. Pollution Prevention Return-on-Investment \n                Programs. Each agency shall develop and implement a \n                pollution prevention program at its facilities that \n                compares the life cycle costs of treatment and/or \n                disposal of waste and pollutant streams to the life \n                cycle costs of alternatives that eliminate or reduce \n                toxic chemicals or pollutants at the source. Each \n                agency shall implement those projects that are life-\n                cycle cost-effective, or otherwise offer substantial \n                environmental or economic benefits.\n\n                Sec. 305. Policies, Strategies, and Plans.\n\n                    (a) Within 12 months of the date of this order, \n                each agency shall ensure that the goals and \n                requirements of this order are incorporated into \n                existing agency environmental directives, policies, and \n                documents affected by the requirements and goals of \n                this order. Where such directives and policies\n\n[[Page 24597]]\n\n                do not already exist, each agency shall, within 12 \n                months of the date of this order, prepare and endorse a \n                written agency environmental management strategy to \n                achieve the requirements and goals of this order. \n                Agency preparation of directives, policies, and \n                documents shall reflect the nature, scale, and \n                environmental impacts of the agency's activities, \n                products, or services. Agencies are encouraged to \n                include elements of relevant agency policies or \n                strategies developed under this part in agency planning \n                documents prepared under the Government Performance and \n                Results Act of 1993, Public Law 103-62.\n                    (b) By March 31, 2002, each agency shall ensure \n                that its facilities develop a written plan that sets \n                forth the facility's contribution to the goals and \n                requirements established in this order. The plan should \n                reflect the size and complexity of the facility. Where \n                pollution prevention plans or other formal \n                environmental planning instruments have been prepared \n                for agency facilities, an agency may elect to update \n                those plans to meet the requirements and goals of this \n                section.\n                    (c) The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) \n                Council shall develop acquisition policies and \n                procedures for contractors to supply agencies with all \n                information necessary for compliance with this order. \n                Once the appropriate FAR clauses have been published, \n                agencies shall use them in all applicable contracts. In \n                addition, to the extent that compliance with this order \n                is made more difficult due to lack of information from \n                existing contractors, or concessioners, each agency \n                shall take practical steps to obtain the information \n                needed to comply with this order from such contractors \n                or concessioners.\n\n                Sec. 306. Interagency Environmental Leadership \n                Workgroup. Within 4 months of the date of this order, \n                EPA shall convene and chair an Interagency \n                Environmental Leadership Workgroup (the Workgroup) with \n                senior-level representatives from all executive \n                agencies and other interested independent Government \n                agencies affected by this order. The Workgroup shall \n                develop policies and guidance required by this order \n                and member agencies shall facilitate implementation of \n                the requirements of this order in their respective \n                agencies.

Each agency is encouraged to \n                cooperate fully with the efforts of the EPA to ensure \n                compliance with those sections.\n                    (b) Whenever the Administrator notifies an agency \n                that it is not in compliance with section 501 or 504 of \n                this order, the agency shall provide the EPA a detailed \n                plan for achieving compliance as promptly as \n                practicable.\n                    (c) The Administrator shall report annually to the \n                President and the public on agency compliance with the \n                provisions of sections 501 and 504 of this order.\n\n                Sec. 407. Improving Environmental Management. To ensure \n                that government-wide goals for pollution prevention are \n                advanced, each agency is encouraged to incorporate its \n                environmental leadership goals into its Strategic and \n                Annual Performance Plans required by the Government \n                Performance and Results Act of 1993, Public Law 103-62, \n                starting with performance plans accompanying the FY \n                2002 budget.\n\n                PART 5--EMERGENCY PLANNING, COMMUNITY RIGHT-TO-KNOW, \n                AND POLLUTION PREVENTION\n\n                Sec. 501. Toxics Release Inventory/Pollution Prevention \n                Act Reporting. To attain the goals of section 203 of \n                this order:\n\n                    (a) Each agency shall comply with the provisions \n                set forth in section 313 of EPCRA, section 6607 of PPA, \n                all implementing regulations, and future amendments to \n                these authorities, in light of applicable EPA guidance.\n                    (b) Each agency shall comply with these provisions \n                without regard to the Standard Industrial \n                Classification (SIC) or North American Industrial \n                Classification System (NAICS) delineations. Except as \n                described in subsection (d) of this section, all other \n                existing statutory or regulatory limitations or\n\n[[Page 24600]]\n\n                exemptions on the application of EPCRA section 313 to \n                specific activities at specific agency facilities apply \n                to the reporting requirements set forth in subsection \n                (a) of this section.\n                    (c) Each agency required to report under subsection \n                (a) of this section shall do so using electronic \n                reporting as provided in EPA's EPCRA section 313 \n                guidance.\n                    (d) Within 12 months of the date of this order, the \n                Administrator shall review the impact on reporting of \n                existing regulatory exemptions on the application of \n                EPCRA section 313 at Federal facilities. Where \n                feasible, this review shall include pilot studies at \n                Federal facilities. If the review indicates that \n                application of existing exemptions to Federal \n                Government reporting under this section precludes \n                public reporting of substantial amounts of toxic \n                chemicals under subsection 501(a), the EPA shall \n                prepare guidance, in coordination with the Workgroup \n                established under section 306 of this order, clarifying \n                application of the exemptions at Federal facilities. In \n                developing the guidance, the EPA should consider \n                similar application of such regulatory limitations and \n                exemptions by the private sector. To the extent \n                feasible, the guidance developed by the EPA shall be \n                consistent with the reasonable application of such \n                regulatory limitations and exemptions in the private \n                sector. The guidance shall ensure reporting consistent \n                with the goal of public access to information under \n                section 313 of EPCRA and section 6607 of PPA. The \n                guidance shall be submitted to the AEEs established \n                under section 301(d) of Executive Order 13101 for \n                review and endorsement. Each agency shall apply any \n                guidance to reporting at its facilities as soon as \n                practicable but no later than for reporting for the \n                next calendar year following release of the guidance.\n                    (e) The EPA shall coordinate with other interested \n                Federal agencies to carry out pilot projects to collect \n                and disseminate information about the release and other \n                waste management of chemicals associated with the \n                environmental response and restoration at their \n                facilities and sites. The pilot projects will focus on \n                releases and other waste management of chemicals \n                associated with environmental response and restoration \n                at facilities and sites where the activities generating \n                wastes do not otherwise meet EPCRA section 313 \n                thresholds for manufacture, process, or other use. Each \n                agency is encouraged to identify applicable facilities \n                and voluntarily report under subsection (a) of this \n                section the releases and other waste management of \n                toxic chemicals managed during environmental response \n                and restoration, regardless of whether the facility \n                otherwise would report under subsection (a). The \n                releases and other waste management of chemicals \n                associated with environmental response and restoration \n                voluntarily reported under this subsection will not be \n                included in the accounting established under sections \n                503(a) and (c) of this order.\n\n                Sec. 502. Release Reduction: Toxic Chemicals. To attain \n                the goals of section 204 of this order:\n\n                    (a) Beginning with reporting for calendar year 2001 \n                activities, each agency reporting under section 501 of \n                this order shall adopt a goal of reducing, where cost \n                effective, the agency's total releases of toxic \n                chemicals to the environment and off-site transfers of \n                such chemicals for treatment and disposal by at least \n                10 percent annually, or by 40 percent overall by \n                December 31, 2006. Beginning with activities for \n                calendar year 2001, the baseline for measuring progress \n                in meeting the reduction goal will be the aggregate of \n                all such releases and off-site transfers of such \n                chemicals for treatment and disposal as reported by all \n                of the agency's facilities under section 501 of this \n                order. The list of toxic chemicals applicable to this \n                goal is the EPCRA section 313 list as of December 1, \n                2000. If an agency achieves the 40 percent reduction \n                goal prior to December 31, 2006, that agency shall \n                establish a new baseline and reduction goal based on \n                agency priorities.\n                    (b) Where an agency is unable to pursue the \n                reduction goal established in subsection (a) for \n                certain chemicals that are mission critical and/or \n                needed to protect human health and the environment or \n                where agency off-site transfer\n\n[[Page 24601]]\n\n                of toxic chemicals for treatment is directly associated \n                with environmental restoration activities, that agency \n                may request a waiver from the EPA for all or part of \n                the requirement in subsection (a) of this section. As \n                appropriate, waiver requests must provide: (1) an \n                explanation of the mission critical use of the \n                chemical; (2) an explanation of the nature of the need \n                for the chemical to protect human health; (3) a \n                description of efforts to identify a less harmful \n                substitute chemical or alternative processes to reduce \n                the release and transfer of the chemical in question; \n                and (4) a description of the off-site transfers of \n                toxic chemicals for treatment directly associated with \n                environmental restoration activities. The EPA shall \n                respond to the waiver request within 90 days and may \n                grant such a waiver for no longer than 2 years. An \n                agency may resubmit a request for waiver at the end of \n                that period. The waiver under this section shall not \n                alter requirements to report under section 501 of this \n                order.\n                    (c) Where a specific component (e.g., bureau, \n                service, or command) within an agency achieves a 75 \n                percent reduction in its 1999 reporting year publicly \n                reported total releases of toxic chemicals to the \n                environment and off-site transfers of such chemicals \n                for treatment and disposal, based on the 1994 baseline \n                established in Executive Order 12856, that agency may \n                independently elect to establish a reduction goal for \n                that component lower than the 40 percent target \n                established in subsection (a) of this section. The \n                agency shall formally notify the Workgroup established \n                in section 306 of this order of the elected reduction \n                target.\n\n                Sec. 503. Use Reduction: Toxic Chemicals, Hazardous \n                Substances, and Other Pollutants. To attain the goals \n                of section 205 of this order:\n\n                    (a) Within 18 months of the date of this order, \n                each agency with facilities shall develop and support \n                goals to reduce the use at such agencies' facilities of \n                the priority chemicals on the list under subsection (b) \n                of this section for identified applications and \n                purposes, or alternative chemicals and pollutants the \n                agency identifies under subsection (c) of this section, \n                by at least 50 percent by December 31, 2006.\n                    (b) Within 9 months of the date of this order the \n                Administrator, in coordination with the Workgroup \n                established in section 306 of this order, shall develop \n                a list of not less than 15 priority chemicals used by \n                the Federal Government that may result in significant \n                harm to human health or the environment and that have \n                known, readily available, less harmful substitutes for \n                identified applications and purposes. In addition to \n                identifying the applications and purposes to which such \n                reductions apply, the Administrator, in coordination \n                with the Workgroup shall identify a usage threshold \n                below which this section shall not apply. The chemicals \n                will be selected from listed EPCRA section 313 toxic \n                chemicals and, where appropriate, other regulated \n                hazardous substances or pollutants. In developing the \n                list, the Administrator, in coordination with the \n                Workgroup shall consider: (1) environmental factors \n                including toxicity, persistence, and bio-accumulation; \n                (2) availability of known, less environmentally harmful \n                substitute chemicals that can be used in place of the \n                priority chemical for identified applications and \n                purposes; (3) availability of known, less \n                environmentally harmful processes that can be used in \n                place of the priority chemical for identified \n                applications and purposes; (4) relative costs of \n                alternative chemicals or processes; and (5) potential \n                risk and environmental and human exposure based upon \n                applications and uses of the chemicals by Federal \n                agencies and facilities. In identifying alternatives, \n                the Administrator should take into consideration the \n                guidance issued under section 503 of Executive Order \n                13101.\n                    (c) If an agency, which has facilities required to \n                report under EPCRA, uses at its facilities less than \n                five of the priority chemicals on the list developed in \n                subsection (b) of this section for the identified \n                applications and purposes, the agency shall develop, \n                within 12 months of the date of this order, a list of \n                not less than five chemicals that may include priority \n                chemicals under subsection (b) of this section or other \n                toxic chemicals, hazardous substances, and/or other \n                pollutants the agency uses or generates,\n\n[[Page 24602]]\n\n                the release, transfer or waste management of which may \n                result in significant harm to human health or the \n                environment.\n                    (d) In lieu of requirements under subsection (a) of \n                this section, an agency may, upon concurrence with the \n                Workgroup established under section 306 of this order, \n                develop within 12 months of the date of this order, a \n                list of not less than five priority hazardous or \n                radioactive waste types generated by its facilities. \n                Within 18 months of the date of this order, the agency \n                shall develop and support goals to reduce the agency's \n                generation of these wastes by at least 50 percent by \n                December 31, 2006. To the maximum extent possible, such \n                reductions shall be achieved by implementing source \n                reduction practices.\n                    (e) The baseline for measuring reductions for \n                purposes of achieving the 50 percent reduction goal in \n                subsections (a) and (d) of this section for each agency \n                is the first calendar year following the development of \n                the list of priority chemicals under subsection (b) of \n                this section.\n                    (f) Each agency shall undertake pilot projects at \n                selected facilities to gather and make publicly \n                available materials accounting data related to the \n                toxic chemicals, hazardous substances, and/or other \n                pollutants identified under subsections (b), (c), or \n                (d) of this section.\n                    (g) Within 12 months of the date of this order, the \n                Administrator shall develop guidance on implementing \n                this section in coordination with the Workgroup. The \n                EPA shall develop technical assistance materials to \n                assist agencies in meeting the 50 percent reduction \n                goal of this section.\n                    (h) Where an agency can demonstrate to the \n                Workgroup that it has previously reduced the use of a \n                priority chemical identified in subsection 503(b) by 50 \n                percent, then the agency may elect to waive the 50 \n                percent reduction goal for that chemical.\n\n                Sec. 504. Emergency Planning and Reporting \n                Responsibilities. Each agency shall comply with the \n                provisions set forth in sections 301 through 312 of the \n                EPCRA, all implementing regulations, and any future \n                amendments to these authorities, in light of any \n                applicable guidance as provided by the EPA.\n\n                Sec. 505. Reductions in Ozone-Depleting Substances. To \n                attain the goals of section 206 of this order:\n\n                    (a) Each agency shall ensure that its facilities: \n                (1) maximize the use of safe alternatives to ozone-\n                depleting substances, as approved by the EPA's \n                Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program; (2) \n                consistent with subsection (b) of this section, \n                evaluate the present and future uses of ozone-depleting \n                substances, including making assessments of existing \n                and future needs for such materials, and evaluate use \n                of, and plans for recycling, refrigerants, and halons; \n                and (3) exercise leadership, develop exemplary \n                practices, and disseminate information on successful \n                efforts in phasing out ozone-depleting substances.\n                    (b) Within 12 months of the date of this order, \n                each agency shall develop a plan to phase out the \n                procurement of Class I ozone-depleting substances for \n                all nonexcepted uses by December 31, 2010. Plans should \n                target cost effective reduction of environmental risk \n                by phasing out Class I ozone depleting substance \n                applications as the equipment using those substances \n                reaches its expected service life.

An agency requesting \n                modification must show that it has made substantial \n                good faith efforts to comply with the order. The cost-\n                effectiveness of implementation of the order can be a \n                factor in OMB's decision to modify the requirements for \n                that agency's compliance with the order.\n\n                PART 9--GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n                Sec. 901.

CLINTON, President of the United States \n                of America, take note that the people of Sierra Leone \n                have suffered the ravages of a brutal civil war for \n                nearly 10 years, and that the United Nations Security \n                Council has determined that the situation in Sierra \n                Leone constitutes a threat to international peace and \n                security in the region and also has expressed concerns \n                regarding the role played by the illicit trade in \n                diamonds in fueling the conflict in Sierra Leone. \n                Sierra Leone's insurgent Revolutionary United Front's \n                (RUF's) illicit trade in diamonds from Sierra Leone to \n                fund its operations and procurement of weapons, the \n                RUF's flagrant violation of the Lome Peace Agreement of \n                July 7, 1999, and its attacks on personnel of the \n                United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone are direct \n                challenges to the United States foreign policy \n                objectives in the region as well as a direct challenge \n                to the rule-based international order which is crucial \n                to the peace and prosperity of the United States. \n                Therefore, I find these actions constitute an unusual \n                and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the \n                United States and hereby declare a national emergency \n                to deal with that threat. In order to implement United \n                Nations Security Council Resolution 1306 and to ensure \n                that the direct or indirect importation into the United \n                States of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone will not \n                contribute financial support to aggressive actions by \n                the RUF or to the RUF's procurement of weapons, while \n                at the same time seeking to avoid undermining the \n                legitimate diamond trade or diminishing confidence in \n                the integrity of the legitimate diamond industry, I \n                hereby order:\n\n                Section 1.

With respect to those persons designated \n                pursuant to subsection 1(d) of this order, the \n                Secretary of the Treasury, in the exercise of his \n                discretion and in consultation with the Secretary of \n                State and the Attorney General, may take such other \n                actions than the complete blocking of property or \n                interests in property as the President is authorized to \n                take under IEEPA and UNPA if the Secretary of the \n                Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State \n                and the Attorney General, deems such other actions to \n                be consistent with the national interests of the United \n                States, considering such factors as he deems \n                appropriate.\n\n                Sec. 6.

The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, \n                is hereby authorized to take such actions, including \n                the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to \n                employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA and \n                UNPA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of \n                this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may \n                redelegate any of these functions to other officers and \n                agencies of the United States Government. All agencies \n                of the United States Government are hereby directed to \n                take all appropriate measures within their authority to \n                carry out the provisions of this order.\n\n                Sec. 8. Nothing in this order is intended to affect the \n                continued effectiveness of any rules, regulations, \n                orders, licenses, or other forms of administrative \n                action issued, taken, or continued in effect heretofore \n                or hereafter under 31 C.F.R. chapter V, except as \n                expressly terminated, modified, or suspended by or \n                pursuant to this order.\n\n                Sec. 9. Nothing contained in this order is intended to \n                create, nor does it create, any right, benefit, or \n                privilege, substantive or procedural, enforceable at \n                law by a party against the United States, its agencies, \n                officers, employees or any other person.\n\n                Sec. 10.

Policy. It is the policy of the executive \n                branch to ensure nondiscrimination in Federal \n                procurement opportunities for businesses in the Small \n                Disadvantaged Business Program (SDBs), businesses in \n                the section 8(a) Business Development program of the \n                Small Business Administration (8(a)s), and Minority \n                Business Enterprises (MBEs) as defined in section 6 of \n                Executive Order 11625, of October 13, 1971, and to take \n                affirmative action to ensure inclusion of these \n                businesses in Federal contracting. These businesses are \n                of vital importance to job growth and the economic \n                strength of the United States but have faced historic \n                exclusion and underutilization in Federal procurement. \n                All agencies within the executive branch with \n                procurement authority are required to take all \n                necessary steps, as permitted by law, to increase \n                contracting between the Federal Government and SDBs, \n                8(a)s, and MBEs.\n\n                Sec. 2.

The head of each \n                executive department and agency shall carry out the \n                terms of this order and shall designate, where \n                appropriate, his or her Deputy Secretary or equivalent \n                to implement the terms of this order.\n\n                    (a) Each department and agency with procurement \n                authority shall:\n\n(i) aggressively seek to ensure that 8(a)s, SDBs, and MBEs are aware of \nfuture prime contracting opportunities through wide dissemination of \ncontract announcements, including sources likely to reach 8(a)s, SDBs, \nother small businesses, and MBEs. Each department and agency shall use all \navailable forms of communication to implement this provision, including the \nInternet, speciality press, and trade press;\n\n(ii) work with the Small Business Administration (SBA) to ensure that \ninformation regarding sole source contracts awarded through the section \n8(a) program receives the widest dissemination possible to 8(a)s;\n\n(iii) ensure that the price evaluation preference programs authorized by \nthe Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 are used to the maximum \nextent permitted by law in areas of economic activity in which SDBs have \nhistorically been underused;\n\n(iv) aggressively use the firms in the section 8(a) program, particularly \nin the developmental stage of the program, so that these firms have an \nopportunity to overcome artificial barriers to Federal contracting and gain \naccess to the Federal procurement arena;\n\n(v) ensure that department and agency heads take all reasonable steps so \nthat prime contractors meet or exceed Federal subcontracting goals, and \nenforce subcontracting commitments as required by the Small Business Act \n(15 U.S.C. 637(d)) and other related laws.

This includes prescribing \nprocedures to ensure that acquisition planners, to the maximum extent \npracticable, structure acquisitions to facilitate competition by SDBs and \n8(a)s, including their participation in the competition of multiple award \nrequirements;\n\n(ix) provide the information required by the Department of Commerce when it \nrequests data to develop the benchmarks used in the price evaluation \npreference programs authorized by the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act \nof 1994;\n\n(x) ensure that Directors of Offices of Small and Disadvantaged Business \nUtilization carry out their responsibilities to maximize the participation \nof 8(a)s and SDBs in Federal procurement and, in particular, ensure that \nthe Directors report directly to the head of each department or agency as \nrequired by law; and\n\n(xi) as required by law, establish with the Small Business Administration \nsmall business goals to ensure that the government-wide goal for \nparticipation of small business concerns is not less than 23 percent of \nFederal prime contracts. Where feasible and consistent with the effective \nand efficient performance of its mission, each agency shall establish a \ngoal of achieving a participation rate for SDBs of not less than 5 percent \nof the total value of prime contract awards for each fiscal year and of not \nless than 5 percent of the total value of subcontract awards for each year. \nEach agency shall also establish a goal for awards made to 8(a) firms \npursuant to section 8(a) of the Small Business Act. These goals shall be \nconsidered the minimum goals and every effort shall be taken to exceed \nthese goals wherever feasible.\n\n                    (b) Each department and agency with procurement \n                authority shall:\n\n(i) develop a long-term comprehensive plan to implement the requirements of \nsection 2(a) of this order and submit this plan to the Director of the \nOffice of Management and Budget (OMB) within 90 days of the date of this \norder. The Director of OMB shall review each plan and report to the \nPresident on the sufficiency of each plan to carry out the terms of this \norder; and\n\n(ii) annually, by April 30 each year, assess its efforts and the results of \nthose efforts to increase utilization of 8(a)s, SDBs, and MBEs as both \nprime contractors and subcontractors and report on those efforts to the \nPresident through the Director of OMB, who shall review the evaluations \nmade of the agency assessments by the Small Business Administration.\n\n                Sec. 3. Responsibilities of the Small Business \n                Administration. The Administrator of the SBA shall:\n\n                    (a) evaluate on a semi-annual basis, using the \n                Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS), the achievement \n                of government-wide prime and subcontract goals and the \n                actual prime and subcontract awards to 8(a)s and SDBs \n                for each department and agency. The OMB shall review \n                SBA's evaluation;\n\n[[Page 60829]]\n\n                    (b) ensure that Procurement Center Representatives \n                receive adequate training regarding the section 8(a) \n                and SDB programs and that they consistently and \n                aggressively seek opportunities for maximizing the use \n                of 8(a)s and SDBs in department and agency \n                procurements; and\n                    (c) ensure that each department and agency's small \n                and disadvantaged business procurement goals as well as \n                the amount of procurement of each department and agency \n                with 8(a)s, SDBs, and MBEs is publicly available in an \n                easily accessible and understandable format such as \n                through publication on the Internet.\n\n                Sec. 4.

Each department and agency shall \n                ensure that all creation, placement, and transmission \n                of Federal advertising is fully reflective of the \n                Nation's diversity. To achieve this diversity, special \n                attention shall be given to ensure placement in \n                publications and television and radio stations that \n                reach specific ethnic and racial audiences. Each \n                department and agency shall ensure that payment for \n                Federal advertising is commensurate with fair market \n                rates in the relevant market. Each department and \n                agency shall structure advertising contracts as \n                commercial acquisitions consistent with part 12 of the \n                Federal Acquisition Regulation processes and paperwork \n                to enhance participation by 8(a)s, SDBs, and MBEs.\n\n                Sec. 5. Information Technology. Each department and \n                agency shall aggressively seek to ensure substantial \n                8(a), SDB, and MBE participation in procurements for \n                and related to information technology, including \n                procurements in the telecommunications industry. In so \n                doing, the Chief Information Officer in each department \n                and agency shall coordinate with procurement officials \n                to implement this section.\n\n                Sec. 6. General Services Administration Schedules. The \n                SBA and the General Services Administration (GSA) shall \n                act promptly to expand inclusion of 8(a)s and SDBs on \n                GSA Schedules, and provide greater opportunities for \n                8(a) and SDB participation in orders under such \n                schedules. The GSA should ensure that procurement and \n                program officials at all levels that use GSA Schedules \n                aggressively seek to utilize the Schedule contracts of \n                8(a)s and SDBs. The GSA shall allow agencies ordering \n                from designated 8(a) firms under the Multiple Award \n                Schedule to count those orders toward their 8(a) \n                procurement goals.\n\n                Sec. 7. Bundling Contracts. To the extent permitted by \n                law, departments and agencies must submit to the SBA \n                for review any contracts that are proposed to be \n                bundled. The determination of the SBA with regard to \n                the appropriateness of bundling in each instance must \n                be carefully reviewed by the department or agency head, \n                or his or her designee, and must be given due \n                consideration.

Policy. Faith-based and other community \n                organizations are indispensable in meeting the needs of \n                poor Americans and distressed neighborhoods. Government \n                cannot be replaced by such organizations, but it can \n                and should welcome them as partners. The paramount goal \n                is compassionate results, and private and charitable \n                community groups, including religious ones, should have \n                the fullest opportunity permitted by law to compete on \n                a level playing field, so long as they achieve valid \n                public purposes, such as curbing crime, conquering \n                addiction, strengthening families and neighborhoods, \n                and overcoming poverty. This delivery of social \n                services must be results oriented and should value the \n                bedrock principles of pluralism, nondiscrimination, \n                evenhandedness, and neutrality.\n\n                Sec. 2.

Functions. The principal functions of the White \n                House OFBCI are, to the extent permitted by law: (a) to \n                develop, lead, and coordinate the Administration's \n                policy agenda affecting faith-based and other community \n                programs and initiatives, expand the role of such \n                efforts in communities, and increase their capacity \n                through executive action, legislation, Federal and \n                private funding, and regulatory relief;\n\n                    (b) to ensure that Administration and Federal \n                Government policy decisions and programs are consistent \n                with the President's stated goals with respect to \n                faith-based and other community initiatives;\n                    (c) to help integrate the President's policy agenda \n                affecting faith-based and other community organizations \n                across the Federal Government;\n                    (d) to coordinate public education activities \n                designed to mobilize public support for faith-based and \n                community nonprofit initiatives through volunteerism, \n                special projects, demonstration pilots, and public-\n                private partnerships;\n                    (e) to encourage private charitable giving to \n                support faith-based and community initiatives;\n                    (f) to bring concerns, ideas, and policy options to \n                the President for assisting, strengthening, and \n                replicating successful faith-based and other community \n                programs;\n                    (g) to provide policy and legal education to State, \n                local, and community policymakers and public officials \n                seeking ways to empower faith-based and\n\n[[Page 8500]]\n\n                other community organizations and to improve the \n                opportunities, capacity, and expertise of such groups;\n                    (h) to develop and implement strategic initiatives \n                under the President's agenda to strengthen the \n                institutions of civil society and America's families \n                and communities;\n                    (i) to showcase and herald innovative grassroots \n                nonprofit organizations and civic initiatives;\n                    (j) to eliminate unnecessary legislative, \n                regulatory, and other bureaucratic barriers that impede \n                effective faith-based and other community efforts to \n                solve social problems;\n                    (k) to monitor implementation of the President's \n                agenda affecting faith-based and other community \n                organizations; and\n                    (l) to ensure that the efforts of faith-based and \n                other community organizations meet high standards of \n                excellence and accountability.\n\n                Sec. 4.

The White House OFBCI \n                shall have such staff and other assistance, to the \n                extent permitted by law, as may be necessary to carry \n                out the provisions of this order. The White House OFBCI \n                operations shall begin no later than 30 days from the \n                date of this order.\n                    (c) The White House OFBCI shall coordinate with the \n                liaison and point of contact designated by each \n                executive department and agency with respect to this \n                initiative.\n                    (d) All executive departments and agencies \n                (agencies) shall cooperate with the White House OFBCI \n                and provide such information, support, and assistance \n                to the White House OFBCI as it may request, to the \n                extent permitted by law.\n                    (e) The agencies' actions directed by this \n                Executive Order shall be carried out subject to the \n                availability of appropriations and to the extent \n                permitted by law.\n\n                Sec. 5.

The handbook shall reflect each \n                agencies' governing policies and provide guidance to \n                each agencies' field staff and partners about the roles \n                and responsibilities needed to make each trail in the \n                national system fully operational.\n\n                Sec. 4. Observance of Existing Laws. Nothing in this \n                Executive Order shall be construed to override existing \n                laws, including those that protect the lands, waters, \n                wildlife habitats, wilderness areas, and cultural \n                values of this Nation.\n\n                Sec. 5. Judicial Review. This order is intended only to \n                improve the internal management of the executive \n                branch.

Preamble. The world's coral reefs--the rain \n                forests of the sea--are in serious decline. These \n                important and sensitive areas of biodiversity warrant \n                special protection. While United States waters contain \n                approximately 3 percent of the world's coral reefs, \n                approximately 70 percent of U.S. coral reefs are in the \n                Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. The 3.5 million acres of \n                coral reefs around the remote, mostly uninhabited \n                Northwestern Hawaiian Islands are spectacular and \n                almost undisturbed by humans. The approximately 1,200 \n                mile stretch of coral islands, seamounts, banks, and \n                shoals are unquestionably some of the healthiest and \n                most extensive coral reefs in the United States. In \n                their own right, the spectacular coral reefs and lands \n                provide an amazing geological record of volcanic and \n                erosive powers that have shaped this area. This vast \n                area supports a dynamic reef ecosystem that supports \n                more than 7,000 marine species, of which approximately \n                half are unique to the Hawaiian Island chain. This \n                incredibly diverse ecosystem is home to many species of \n                coral, fish, birds, marine mammals, and other flora and \n                fauna including the endangered Hawaiian monk seal, the \n                threatened green sea turtle, and the endangered \n                leatherback and hawksbill sea turtles. In addition, \n                this area has great cultural significance to Native \n                Hawaiians as well as linkages to early Polynesian \n                culture--making it additionally worthy of protection \n                and understanding. This is truly a unique and special \n                place, a coral reef ecosystem like no place on earth, \n                and a source of pride, inspiration, and satisfaction \n                for all Americans, especially the people of Hawaii. It \n                is fully worthy of our best efforts to preserve a \n                legacy of America's natural wonders for future \n                generations. Due to the special significance of this \n                area, I have determined that it is in the best interest \n                of our Nation, and of future generations, to provide \n                strong and lasting protection for the coral reef \n                ecosystem of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.\n\n                On May 26, 2000, I directed the Secretaries of Commerce \n                and the Interior, working cooperatively with the State \n                of Hawaii and consulting with the Western Pacific \n                Fishery Management Council, to develop recommendations \n                for a new, coordinated management regime to increase \n                protection of the coral reef ecosystem of the \n                Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and provide for \n                sustainable use of the area. Upon consideration of \n                their recommendations and comments received during the \n                public visioning process on this initiative, and based \n                on the statutory authorities set forth above, I am \n                issuing this Executive Order.\n\n[[Page 76904]]\n\n                Sec. 2. Purpose. The purpose of this Executive Order is \n                to ensure the comprehensive, strong, and lasting \n                protection of the coral reef ecosystem and related \n                marine resources and species (resources) of the \n                Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.\n\n                Sec. 3.

I \n                expanded the scope of that emergency in Executive Order \n                13213 and prohibited absolutely the importation of \n                rough diamonds from Liberia. I further note that \n                representatives of the United States and numerous other \n                countries announced in the Interlaken Declaration of \n                November 5, 2002, the launch of the Kimberley Process \n                Certification Scheme (KPCS) for rough diamonds, under \n                which Participants prohibit the importation of rough \n                diamonds from, or the exportation of rough diamonds to, \n                a non-Participant and require that shipments of rough \n                diamonds from or to a Participant be controlled through \n                the KPCS. The Clean Diamond Trade Act authorizes the \n                President to take steps to implement the KPCS. \n                Therefore, in order to implement the Act, to harmonize \n                Executive Orders 13194 and 13213 with the Act, to \n                address further threats to international peace and \n                security posed by the trade in conflict diamonds, and \n                to avoid undermining the legitimate diamond trade, it \n                is hereby ordered as follows:\n\n                Section 1.

(NHPA) and the National \n                Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), it \n                is hereby ordered:\n\n                Section 1. Statement of Policy. It is the policy of the \n                Federal Government to provide leadership in preserving \n                America's heritage by actively advancing the \n                protection, enhancement, and contemporary use of the \n                historic properties owned by the Federal Government, \n                and by promoting intergovernmental cooperation and \n                partnerships for the preservation and use of historic \n                properties. The Federal Government shall recognize and \n                manage the historic properties in its ownership as \n                assets that can support department and agency missions \n                while contributing to the vitality and economic well-\n                being of the Nation's communities and fostering a \n                broader appreciation for the development of the United \n                States and its underlying values. Where consistent with \n                executive branch department and agency missions, \n                governing law, applicable preservation standards, and \n                where appropriate, executive branch departments and \n                agencies (``agency'' or ``agencies'') shall advance \n                this policy through the protection and continued use of \n                the historic properties owned by the Federal \n                Government, and by pursuing partnerships with State and \n                local governments, Indian tribes, and the private \n                sector to promote the preservation of the unique \n                cultural heritage of communities and of the Nation and \n                to realize the economic benefit that these properties \n                can provide. Agencies shall maximize efforts to \n                integrate the policies, procedures, and practices of \n                the NHPA and this order into their program activities \n                in order to efficiently and effectively advance \n                historic preservation objectives in the pursuit of \n                their missions.\n\n                Sec. 2. Building Preservation Partnerships. When \n                carrying out its mission activities, each agency, where \n                consistent with its mission and governing authorities, \n                and where appropriate, shall seek partnerships with \n                State and local governments, Indian tribes, and the \n                private sector to promote local economic development \n                and vitality through the use of historic properties in \n                a manner that contributes to the long-term preservation \n                and productive use of those properties. Each agency \n                shall examine its policies, procedures, and \n                capabilities to ensure that its actions encourage, \n                support, and foster public-private initiatives and \n                investment in the use, reuse, and rehabilitation of \n                historic properties, to the extent such support is not \n                inconsistent with other provisions of law, the \n                Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Archeology \n                and Historic Preservation, and essential national \n                department and agency mission requirements.\n\n                Sec. 3. Improving Federal Agency Planning and \n                Accountability. (a) Accurate information on the state \n                of Federally owned historic properties is essential to \n                achieving the goals of this order and to promoting \n                community economic development through local \n                partnerships. Each agency with real property management \n                responsibilities shall prepare an assessment of the \n                current status of its inventory of historic properties \n                required by section 110(a)(2) of the NHPA (16 U.S.C. \n                470h-2(a)(2)), the general condition and management \n                needs of such properties, and the steps underway or \n                planned to meet those management needs. The assessment \n                shall also include an evaluation of the suitability of \n                the agency's types of historic properties to contribute \n                to community economic development initiatives, \n                including heritage tourism, taking into\n\n[[Page 10636]]\n\n                account agency mission needs, public access \n                considerations, and the long-term preservation of the \n                historic properties. No later than September 30, 2004, \n                each covered agency shall complete a report of the \n                assessment and make it available to the Chairman of the \n                Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (Council) and \n                the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary).\n\n                    (b) No later than September 30, 2004, each agency \n                with real property management responsibilities shall \n                review its regulations, management policies, and \n                operating procedures for compliance with sections 110 \n                and 111 of the NHPA (16 U.S.C. 470h-2 &amp; 470-3) and make \n                the results of its review available to the Council and \n                the Secretary. If the agency determines that its \n                regulations, management policies, and operating \n                procedures are not in compliance with those \n                authorities, the agency shall make amendments or \n                revisions to bring them into compliance.\n                    (c) Each agency with real property management \n                responsibilities shall, by September 30, 2005, and \n                every third year thereafter, prepare a report on its \n                progress in identifying, protecting, and using historic \n                properties in its ownership and make the report \n                available to the Council and the Secretary. The Council \n                shall incorporate this data into a report on the state \n                of the Federal Government's historic properties and \n                their contribution to local economic development and \n                submit this report to the President by February 15, \n                2006, and every third year thereafter.\n                    (d) Agencies may use existing information gathering \n                and reporting systems to fulfill the assessment and \n                reporting requirements of subsections 3(a)-(c) of this \n                order. To assist agencies, the Council, in consultation \n                with the Secretary, shall, by September 30, 2003, \n                prepare advisory guidelines for agencies to use at \n                their discretion.\n                    (e) No later than June 30, 2003, the head of each \n                agency shall designate a senior policy level official \n                to have policy oversight responsibility for the \n                agency's historic preservation program and notify the \n                Council and the Secretary of the designation. This \n                senior official shall be an assistant secretary, deputy \n                assistant secretary, or the equivalent, as appropriate \n                to the agency organization. This official, or a \n                subordinate employee reporting directly to the \n                official, shall serve as the agency's Federal \n                Preservation Officer in accordance with section 110(c) \n                of the NHPA. The senior official shall ensure that the \n                Federal Preservation Officer is qualified consistent \n                with guidelines established by the Secretary for that \n                position and has access to adequate expertise and \n                support to carry out the duties of the position.\n\n                Sec. 4. Improving Federal Stewardship of Historic \n                Properties. (a) Each agency shall ensure that the \n                management of historic properties in its ownership is \n                conducted in a manner that promotes the long-term \n                preservation and use of those properties as Federal \n                assets and, where consistent with agency missions, \n                governing law, and the nature of the properties, \n                contributes to the local community and its economy.\n\n                    (b) Where consistent with agency missions and the \n                Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Archeology \n                and Historic Preservation, and where appropriate, \n                agencies shall cooperate with communities to increase \n                opportunities for public benefit from, and access to, \n                Federally owned historic properties.\n                    (c) The Council is directed to use its existing \n                authority to encourage and accept donations of money, \n                equipment, and other resources from public and private \n                parties to assist other agencies in the preservation of \n                historic properties in Federal ownership to fulfill the \n                goals of the NHPA and this order.\n                    (d) The National Park Service, working with the \n                Council and in consultation with other agencies, shall \n                make available existing materials and information for \n                education, training, and awareness of historic property \n                stewardship to ensure that all Federal personnel have \n                access to information and can develop the skills \n                necessary to continue the productive use of Federally \n                owned historic properties while meeting their \n                stewardship responsibilities.\n\n[[Page 10637]]\n\n                    (e) The Council, in consultation with the National \n                Park Service and other agencies, shall encourage and \n                recognize exceptional achievement by such agencies in \n                meeting the goals of the NHPA and this order. By March \n                31, 2004, the Council shall submit to the President and \n                the heads of agencies recommendations to further \n                stimulate initiative, creativity, and efficiency in the \n                Federal stewardship of historic properties.\n\n                Sec. 5. Promoting Preservation Through Heritage \n                Tourism.\n\n                    (a) To the extent permitted by law and within \n                existing resources, the Secretary of Commerce, working \n                with the Council and other agencies, shall assist \n                States, Indian tribes, and local communities in \n                promoting the use of historic properties for heritage \n                tourism and related economic development in a manner \n                that contributes to the long-term preservation and \n                productive use of those properties. Such assistance \n                shall include efforts to strengthen and improve \n                heritage tourism activities throughout the country as \n                they relate to Federally owned historic properties and \n                significant natural assets on Federal lands.\n                    (b) Where consistent with agency missions and \n                governing law, and where appropriate, agencies shall \n                use historic properties in their ownership in \n                conjunction with State, tribal, and local tourism \n                programs to foster viable economic partnerships, \n                including, but not limited to, cooperation and \n                coordination with tourism officials and others with \n                interests in the properties.\n\n                Sec. 6. National and Homeland Security Considerations.\n\n                Nothing in this order shall be construed to require any \n                agency to take any action or disclose any information \n                that would conflict with or compromise national and \n                homeland security goals, policies, programs, or \n                activities.\n\n                Sec. 7. Definitions. For the purposes of this order, \n                the term ``historic property'' means any prehistoric or \n                historic district, site, building, structure, and \n                object included on or eligible for inclusion on the \n                National Register of Historic Places in accordance with \n                section 301(5) of the NHPA (16 U.S.C. 470w(5)). The \n                term ``heritage tourism'' means the business and \n                practice of attracting and accommodating visitors to a \n                place or area based especially on the unique or special \n                aspects of that locale's history, landscape (including \n                trail systems), and culture. The terms ``Federally \n                owned'' and ``in Federal ownership,'' and similar \n                terms, as used in this order, do not include properties \n                acquired by agencies as a result of foreclosure or \n                similar actions and that are held for a period of less \n                than 5 years.\n\n                Sec. 8.

(a) The Director of the \n                Office of Management and Budget shall review, through \n                the management and budget review processes, the efforts \n                of departments and agencies in implementing their asset \n                management plans and achieving the Government-wide \n                property management policies established pursuant to \n                this order.\n\n                    (b) The Office of Management and Budget and the \n                General Services Administration shall, in consultation \n                with the landholding agencies, develop legislative \n                initiatives that seek to improve Federal real property \n                management through the adoption of appropriate industry \n                management techniques and the establishment of \n                managerial accountability for implementing effective \n                and efficient real property management practices.\n                    (c) Nothing in this order shall be construed to \n                impair or otherwise affect the authority of the \n                Director of the Office of Management and Budget with \n                respect to budget, administrative, or legislative \n                proposals.\n                    (d) Nothing in this order shall be construed to \n                affect real property for the use of the President, Vice \n                President, or, for protective purposes, the United \n                States Secret Service.\n\n                Sec. 7. Public Lands. In order to ensure that Federally \n                owned lands, other than the real property covered by \n                this order, are managed in the most effective and \n                economic manner, the Departments of Agriculture and the \n                Interior shall take such steps as are appropriate to \n                improve their management of public lands and National \n                Forest System lands and shall develop appropriate \n                legislative proposals necessary to facilitate that \n                result.\n\n                Sec. 8.

Establishment. There is established the \n                President's Council on Bioethics (the ``Council'').\n\n                Sec. 2. Mission.\n\n                    (a) The Council shall advise the President on \n                bioethical issues that may emerge as a consequence of \n                advances in biomedical science and technology. In \n                connection with its advisory role, the mission of the \n                Council includes the following functions:\n\n  (1) to undertake fundamental inquiry into the human and moral \nsignificance of developments in biomedical and behavioral science and \ntechnology;\n\n  (2) to explore specific ethical and policy questions related to these \ndevelopments;\n\n  (3) to provide a forum for a national discussion of bioethical issues;\n\n  (4) to facilitate a greater understanding of bioethical issues; and\n\n  (5) to explore possibilities for useful international collaboration on \nbioethical issues.\n\n                    (b) In support of its mission, the Council may \n                study ethical issues connected with specific \n                technological activities, such as embryo and stem cell \n                research, assisted reproduction, cloning, uses of \n                knowledge and techniques derived from human genetics or \n                the neurosciences, and end of life issues. The Council \n                may also study broader ethical and social issues not \n                tied to a specific technology, such as questions \n                regarding the protection of human subjects in research, \n                the appropriate uses of biomedical technologies, the \n                moral implications of biomedical technologies, and the \n                consequences of limiting scientific research.\n                    (c) The Council shall strive to develop a deep and \n                comprehensive understanding of the issues that it \n                considers. In pursuit of this goal, the Council shall \n                be guided by the need to articulate fully the complex \n                and often competing moral positions on any given issue, \n                rather than by an overriding concern to find consensus. \n                The Council may therefore choose to proceed by offering \n                a variety of views on a particular issue, rather than \n                attempt to reach a single consensus position.\n                    (d) The Council shall not be responsible for the \n                review and approval of specific projects or for \n                devising and overseeing regulations for specific \n                government agencies.\n                    (e) In support of its mission, the Council may \n                accept suggestions of issues for consideration from the \n                heads of other Government agencies and other sources, \n                as it deems appropriate.\n                    (f) In establishing priorities for its activities, \n                the Council shall consider the urgency and gravity of \n                the particular issue; the need for policy guidance and \n                public education on the particular issue; the \n                connection of the bioethical issue to the goal of \n                Federal advancement of science and technology; and the \n                existence of another entity available to deliberate \n                appropriately on the bioethical issue.\n\n[[Page 59852]]\n\n                Sec. 3. Membership.\n\n                    (a) The Council shall be composed of not more than \n                18 members appointed by the President from among \n                individuals who are not officers or employees of the \n                Federal Government. The Council shall include members \n                drawn from the fields of science and medicine, law and \n                government, philosophy and theology, and other areas of \n                the humanities and social sciences.\n                    (b) The President shall designate a member of the \n                Council to serve as Chairperson.\n                    (c) The term of office of a member shall be 2 \n                years, and members shall be eligible for reappointment. \n                Members may continue to serve after the expiration of \n                their terms until the President appoints a successor. A \n                member appointed to fill a vacancy shall serve only for \n                the unexpired term of such vacancy.\n\n                Sec. 4.

For those persons whose property and interests \n                in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this \n                order who might have a constitutional presence in the \n                United States, I find that because of the ability to \n                transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior \n                notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant \n                to this order would render these measures ineffectual. \n                I therefore determine that for these measures to be \n                effective in addressing the national emergency declared \n                in Executive Order 13047, there need be no prior notice \n                of a listing or determination made pursuant to this \n                order.\n\n                Sec. 8. Determining that such a waiver is in the \n                national interest of the United States, I hereby waive \n                the prohibitions described in section 3 of the Burmese \n                Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 with respect to any \n                and all articles that are a product of Burma to the \n                extent that prohibiting the importation of such \n                articles would conflict with the international \n                obligations of the United States under the Vienna \n                Convention on Diplomatic Relations, the Vienna \n                Convention on Consular Relations, the United Nations \n                Headquarters Agreement, and other legal instruments \n                providing equivalent privileges and immunities.\n\n                Sec. 9. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to \n                take such actions, including the promulgation of rules \n                and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to \n                the President by IEEPA and sections 3(a) and 4 of the \n                Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003, other than \n                the authority to make the determinations and \n                certification to the Congress that Burma has met the \n                conditions described in 3(a)(3) of the Act, as may be \n                necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The \n                Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these \n                functions to other officers and agencies of the United \n                States Government consistent with applicable law. The \n                Secretary of State is authorized to exercise the \n                functions and authorities conferred upon the President \n                by section 3(b) of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy \n                Act of 2003 and to redelegate these functions and \n                authorities consistent with applicable law. All \n                agencies of the United States Government are hereby \n                directed to take all appropriate measures within their \n                authority to carry out the provisions of this order.\n\n[[Page 44855]]\n\n                Sec. 10. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State, is authorized to \n                determine, subsequent to the issuance of this order, \n                that circumstances no longer warrant inclusion of a \n                person in the Annex to this order and that the property \n                and interests in property of that person are therefore \n                no longer blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order.\n\n                Sec. 11.

This order is issued consistent with \n                the following findings and principles:\n\n                    (a) Growing scientific evidence indicates that an \n                increasing number of Americans are suffering from \n                negligible physical activity, poor dietary habits, \n                insufficient utilization of preventive health \n                screenings, and engaging in risky behaviors such as \n                abuse of alcohol, tobacco, and drugs.\n                    (b) Existing information on the importance of \n                appropriate physical activity, diet, preventive health \n                screenings, and avoiding harmful substances is often \n                not received by the public, or, if received, is not \n                acted on sufficiently.\n                    (c) Individuals of all ages, locations, and levels \n                of personal fitness can benefit from some level of \n                appropriate physical activity, dietary guidance, \n                preventive health screening, and making healthy \n                choices.\n                    (d) While personal fitness is an individual \n                responsibility, the Federal Government may, within the \n                authority and funds otherwise available, expand the \n                opportunities for individuals to empower themselves to \n                improve their general health. Such opportunities may \n                include improving the flow of information about \n                personal fitness, assisting in the utilization of that \n                information, increasing the accessibility of resources \n                for physical activity, and reducing barriers to \n                achieving good personal fitness.\n\n                Sec. 2. Agency Responsibilities in Promoting Personal \n                Fitness.\n\n                    (a) The Secretaries of Agriculture, Education, \n                Health and Human Services (HHS), Housing and Urban \n                Development, Interior, Labor, Transportation, and \n                Veterans Affairs, and the Director of the Office of \n                National Drug Policy shall review and evaluate the \n                policies, programs, and regulations of their respective \n                departments and offices that in any way relate to the \n                personal fitness of the general public. Based on that \n                review, the Secretaries and the Director shall \n                determine whether existing policies, programs, and \n                regulations of their respective departments and offices \n                should be modified or whether new policies or programs \n                could be implemented. These new policies and programs \n                shall be consistent with otherwise available authority \n                and appropriated funds, and shall improve the Federal \n                Government's assistance of individuals, private \n                organizations, and State and local governments to (i) \n                increase physical activity; (ii) promote responsible \n                dietary habits; (iii) increase utilization of \n                preventive health screenings; and (iv) encourage \n                healthy choices concerning alcohol, tobacco, drugs, and \n                safety among the general public.\n                    (b) Each department and office included in section \n                2(a) shall report to the President, through the \n                Secretary of Health and Human Services, its proposed \n                actions within 90 days of the date of this order.\n                    (c) There shall be a Personal Fitness Interagency \n                Working Group (Working Group), composed of the \n                Secretaries or Director of the departments and office \n                included in section 2(a) (or their designees) and \n                chaired by the Secretary of HHS or his designee. In \n                order to improve efficiency through information sharing \n                and to eliminate waste and overlap, the Working Group \n                shall\n\n[[Page 42468]]\n\n                work to ensure the cooperation of Federal agencies in \n                coordinating Federal personal fitness activities.

The emergency \n                board terminated upon issuance of its report. \n                Subsequently, its recommendations were not accepted by \n                the parties.\n\n                A party empowered by the Act has requested that the \n                President establish a second emergency board pursuant \n                to section 9A of the Act (45 U.S.C. 159a).\n\n                Section 9A(e) of the Act provides that the President, \n                upon such request, shall appoint a second emergency \n                board to investigate and report on the dispute.\n\n                NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as \n                President by the Constitution and the laws of the \n                United States, including section 9A of the Act, it is \n                hereby ordered as follows:\n\n                Section 1. Establishment of Emergency Board \n                (``Board''). There is established, effective August 10, \n                2004, a Board of three members to be appointed by the \n                President to investigate and report on this dispute.

R.C.M. 201(f)(2)(B) is amended to read as \n                follows:\n\n   ``(i) Upon a finding of guilty, special courts-martial may adjudge, \nunder limitations prescribed by this Manual, any punishment authorized \nunder R.C.M. 1003 except death, dishonorable discharge, dismissal, \nconfinement for more than 1 year, hard labor without confinement for more \nthan 3 months, forfeiture of pay exceeding two-thirds pay per month, or any \nforfeiture of pay for more than 1 year.\n\n   ``(ii) A bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more than six months, or \nforfeiture of pay for more than six months, may not be adjudged by a \nspecial court-martial unless:\n\n                       ``(a) Counsel qualified under Article 27(b) is \n                    detailed to represent the accused; and\n                       ``(b) A military judge is detailed to the trial, \n                    except in a case in which a military judge could \n                    not be detailed because of physical conditions or \n                    military exigencies. Physical conditions or \n                    military exigencies, as the terms are here used, \n                    may exist under rare circumstances, such as on an \n                    isolated ship on the high seas or in a unit in an \n                    inaccessible area, provided compelling reasons \n                    exist why the trial must be held at that time and \n                    at that place.

R.C.M. 701(b)(4) is amended to read as follows:\n\n   ``(4) Reports of examination and tests.

For purposes of this rule, there is \na ``conviction'' in a court-martial case when a sentence has been adjudged. \nIn a civilian case, a ``conviction'' includes any disposition following an \ninitial judicial determination or assumption of guilt, such as when guilt \nhas been established by guilty plea, trial, or plea of nolo contendere, \nregardless of the subsequent disposition, sentencing procedure, or final \njudgment. However, a ``civilian conviction'' does not include a diversion \nfrom the judicial process without a finding or admission of guilt; expunged \nconvictions; juvenile adjudications; minor traffic violations; foreign \nconvictions; tribal court convictions; or convictions reversed, vacated, \ninvalidated or pardoned because of errors of law or because of subsequently \ndiscovered evidence exonerating the accused.''.\n\n                    e. R.C.M. 1003(b)(3) is amended to read as follows:\n\n   ``(3) Fine. Any court-martial may adjudge a fine in lieu of or in \naddition to forfeitures. Special and summary courts-martial may not adjudge \nany fine or combination of fine and forfeitures in excess of the total \namount of forfeitures that may be adjudged in that case. In order to \nenforce collection, a fine may be accompanied by a provision in the \nsentence that, in the event the fine is not paid, the person fined shall, \nin addition to any period of confinement adjudged, be further confined \nuntil a fixed period considered an equivalent punishment to the fine has \nexpired.

R.C.M. 1003(b)(7) is amended to read as follows:\n\n   ``(7) Confinement. The place of confinement shall not be designated by \nthe court-martial. When confinement for life is authorized, it may be with \nor without eligibility for parole. A court-martial shall not adjudge a \nsentence to solitary confinement or to confinement without hard labor;''.\n\n                    g.

Discredit means to injure the reputation of the armed forces \nand includes adulterous conduct that has a tendency, because of its open or \nnotorious nature, to bring the service into disrepute, make it subject to \npublic ridicule, or lower it in public esteem.

Other appropriate matters may also be \n                addressed by such a protective order.

A military judge should not issue a protective \n                order without first providing notice to the parties and \n                an opportunity to be heard. The military judge must \n                state on the record the reasons for issuing the \n                protective order. If the reasons for issuing the order \n                change, the military judge may reconsider the continued \n                necessity for a protective order.''\n\n                f. The first paragraph of the Discussion following \n                R.C.M. 808 is amended to read as follows:\n\n                    ``Except in a special court-martial not authorized \n                to adjudge a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for \n                more than six months, or forfeiture of pay for more \n                than six months, the trial counsel should ensure that a \n                qualified court reporter is detailed to the court-\n                martial. Trial counsel should also ensure that all \n                exhibits and other documents relating to the case are \n                properly maintained for later inclusion in the record. \n                See also R.C.M. 1103(j) as to the use of videotapes, \n                audiotapes, and similar recordings for the record of \n                trial. Because of the potential requirement for a \n                verbatim transcript, all proceedings, including sidebar \n                conferences, arguments, and rulings and instructions by \n                the military judge, should be recorded.''\n\n[[Page 18781]]\n\n                g. The Discussion following R.C.M. 1001(b)(3)(A) is \n                amended by adding the following at the end of the \n                Discussion:\n\n                    ``Whether a civilian conviction is admissible is \n                left to the discretion of the military judge. As stated \n                in the rule, a civilian ``conviction'' includes any \n                disposition following an initial judicial determination \n                or assumption of guilt regardless of the sentencing \n                procedure and the final judgment following probation or \n                other sentence. Therefore, convictions may be \n                admissible regardless of whether a court ultimately \n                suspended judgment upon discharge of the accused \n                following probation, permitted withdrawal of the guilty \n                plea, or applies some other form of alternative \n                sentencing. Additionally, the term ``conviction'' need \n                not be taken to mean a final judgment of conviction and \n                sentence.''\n\n                h. The sixth paragraph of the Discussion following \n                R.C.M. 1003(b)(2) is amended to read as follows:\n\n                    ``At a special court-martial, if a bad-conduct \n                discharge and confinement are adjudged, then the \n                operation of Article 58b results in a forfeiture of \n                two-thirds of pay only (not allowances) during that \n                period of confinement. If only confinement is adjudged, \n                and that confinement exceeds six months, then the \n                operation of Article 58b results in a forfeiture of \n                two-thirds of pay only (not allowances) during the \n                period of confinement. If only a bad conduct discharge \n                is adjudged, Article 58b has no effect on pay.''.\n\n                i. The Discussion following R.C.M. 1003(b)(3) is \n                amended by adding at the end the following paragraph:\n\n                    ``Where the sentence adjudged at a special court-\n                martial includes a fine, see R.C.M. 1107(d)(5) for \n                limitations on convening authority action on the \n                sentence.''\n\n                j. The Discussion following R.C.M. 1003(b)(8) is \n                amended by adding the following at the end of the \n                Discussion:\n\n                    ``See Article 56a.''\n\n                k. The Discussion following R.C.M. 1003(c)(4) is \n                amended by striking ``R.C.M. 1107(d)(3)'' and inserting \n                ``R.C.M. 1107(d)(4).''\n\n                l. The Discussion following R.C.M. 1006(c) is amended \n                to read as follows:\n\n                    ``A proposal should state completely each kind and, \n                where appropriate, amount of authorized punishment \n                proposed by that member. For example, a proposal of \n                confinement for life would state whether it is with or \n                without eligibility for parole. See R.C.M. 1003(b).''\n\n                m. The second paragraph of the Discussion following \n                R.C.M. 1107(d)(1) is amended to read as follows:\n\n                    ``When mitigating forfeitures, the duration and \n                amounts of forfeiture may be changed as long as the \n                total amount forfeited is not increased and neither the \n                amount nor duration of the forfeitures exceeds the \n                jurisdiction of the court-martial. When mitigating \n                confinement or hard labor without confinement, the \n                convening authority should use the equivalencies at \n                R.C.M. 1003(b)(6) and (7), as appropriate. One form of \n                punishment may be changed to a less severe punishment \n                of a different nature, as long as the changed \n                punishment is one that the court-martial could have \n                adjudged. For example, a bad-conduct discharge adjudged \n                by a special court-martial could be changed to \n                confinement for up to one year (but not vice versa). A \n                pretrial agreement may also affect what punishments may \n                be changed by the convening authority.''.\n\n                n. The Discussion following R.C.M. 1109(f) is amended \n                to read as follows:\n\n                    ``An officer exercising special court-martial \n                jurisdiction may vacate any suspended punishments other \n                than an approved suspended bad-conduct discharge or any \n                suspended portion of an approved sentence to \n                confinement for one year, regardless of whether they \n                are contained in the same sentence as the bad-conduct \n                discharge or confinement for one year.

The opportunity to be heard \n                may be extended to representatives of the media in the \n                appropriate case.\n                    ``Section (d) is based on the first Recommendation \n                Relating to the Conduct of Judicial Proceedings in \n                Criminal Cases, included in the Revised Report of the \n                Judicial Conference Committee on the Operation of the \n                Jury System on the ``Free Press--Fair Trial'' Issue, 87 \n                F.R.D. 519, 529 (1980), which was approved by the \n                Judicial Conference of the United States on September \n                25, 1980. The requirement that the protective order be \n                issued in writing is based on Rule for Courts-Martial \n                405(g)(6). Section (d) adopts a ``substantial \n                likelihood of material prejudice'' standard in place of \n                the Judicial Conference recommendation of a ``likely to \n                interfere'' standard. The Judicial Conference's \n                recommendation was issued before the Supreme Court's \n                decision in Gentile v. State Bar of Nev., 501 U.S. 1030 \n                (1991). Gentile, which dealt with a Rule of \n                Professional Conduct governing extrajudicial \n                statements, indicates that a lawyer may be disciplined \n                for making statements that present a substantial \n                likelihood of material prejudice to an accused's right \n                to a fair trial. While the use of protective orders is \n                distinguishable from limitations imposed by a bar's \n                ethics rule, the Gentile decision expressly recognized \n                that the ``speech of lawyers representing clients in \n                pending cases may be regulated under a less demanding \n                standard than that established for regulation of the \n                press in Nebraska Press Ass'n v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539 \n                (1976), and the cases which preceded it.'' 501 U.S. at \n                1074. The Court concluded that ``the `substantial \n                likelihood of material prejudice' standard constitutes \n                a constitutionally permissible balance between the \n                First Amendment rights of attorneys in pending cases \n                and the State's interest in fair trials.'' Id. at 1075. \n                Gentile also supports the constitutionality of \n                restricting communications of non-lawyer participants \n                in a court case. Id. at 1072-73 (citing Seattle Times \n                Co. v. Rhinehart, 467 U.S. 20, 32-33 (1984)). \n                Accordingly, a protective order issued under the \n                ``substantial likelihood of material prejudice'' \n                standard is constitutionally permissible.\n                    ``The first sentence of the discussion is based on \n                the committee comment to the Recommendations Relating \n                to the Conduct of Judicial Proceedings in Criminal \n                Cases.

The Analysis accompanying R.C.M. 1001(b)(3)(A) is \n                amended by inserting the following at the end thereof:\n\n                    ``2002 Amendment: As previously written, R.C.M. \n                1001(b)(3)(A) offered little guidance about what it \n                meant by ``civilian convictions.'' See, e.g., United \n                States v. White, 47 M.J. 139, 140 (C.A.A.F. 1997); \n                United States v. Barnes, 33 M.J. 468, 472-73 (C.M.A. \n                1992); United States v. Slovacek, 24 M.J. 140, 141 \n                (CMA), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 855 (1987). The present \n                rule addresses this void and intends to give the \n                sentencing authority as\n\n[[Page 18785]]\n\n                much information as the military judge determines is \n                relevant in order to craft an appropriate sentence for \n                the accused.\n                    ``Unlike most civilian courts, this rule does not \n                allow admission of more extensive criminal history \n                information, such as arrests. Use of such additional \n                information is not appropriate in the military setting \n                where court-martial members, not a military judge, \n                often decide the sentence. Such information risks \n                unnecessarily confusing the members.\n                    ``The present rule clarifies the term \n                ``conviction'' in light of the complex and varying ways \n                civilian jurisdictions treat the subject. The military \n                judge may admit relevant evidence of civilian \n                convictions without necessarily being bound by the \n                action, procedure, or nomenclature of civilian \n                jurisdictions. Examples of judicial determinations \n                admissible as convictions under this rule include \n                accepted pleas of nolo contendere, pleas accepted under \n                North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25 (1970), or \n                deferred sentences. If relevant, evidence of forfeiture \n                of bail that results in a judicial determination of \n                guilt is also admissible, as recognized in United \n                States v. Eady, 35 M.J. 15, 16 (C.M.A. 1992). While no \n                time limit is placed upon the admissibility of prior \n                convictions, the military judge should conduct a \n                balancing test to determine whether convictions older \n                than ten years should be admitted or excluded on the \n                basis of relevance and fundamental fairness.\n                    ``The two central factors in this rule are (1) \n                judicial determination of guilt and (2) assumption of \n                guilt. Assumption of guilt is an all-inclusive term \n                meaning any act by the accused in a judicial proceeding \n                accepting, acknowledging, or admitting guilt. As long \n                as either factor is present, the ``conviction'' is \n                admissible, if relevant. Consequently, this rule \n                departs from the holding in United States v. Hughes, 26 \n                M.J. 119, 120 (C.M.A. 1988), where the accused pleaded \n                guilty in a Texas court, but the judge did not enter a \n                finding of guilty under state law allowing ``deferred \n                adjudications.'' Under the present rule, the \n                ``conviction'' would be admissible because the accused \n                pleaded guilty in a judicial proceeding, \n                notwithstanding the fact that the state judge did not \n                enter a finding of guilty.\n                    ``In contrast, ``deferred prosecutions,'' where \n                there is neither an admission of guilt in a judicial \n                proceeding nor a finding of guilty, would be excluded. \n                The rule also excludes expunged convictions, juvenile \n                adjudications, minor traffic violations, foreign \n                convictions, and tribal court convictions as matters \n                inappropriate for or unnecessarily confusing to courts-\n                martial members. What constitutes a ``minor traffic \n                violation'' within the meaning of this rule is to be \n                decided with reference only to federal law, and not to \n                the laws of individual states. See U.S. Sentencing \n                Guidelines Manual Sec.  4A1.2(c)(2); ``What Constitutes \n                `Minor Traffic Infraction' Excludable From Calculation \n                of Defendant's Criminal History under United States \n                Sentencing Guideline Sec.  4A1.2(c)(2),'' 113 A.L.R. \n                Fed. 561 (1993).\n                    ``Additionally, because of the lack of clarity in \n                the previous rule, courts sometimes turned to Mil.

R. \n                Evid. 609 and the present rule differ greatly, a \n                conviction that may not be appropriate for impeachment \n                purposes under Mil. R. Evid. 609, may nevertheless be \n                admissible under the present rule.\n                    ``The Federal Sentencing Guidelines were consulted \n                when drafting the present rule. Although informed by \n                those guidelines, the present rule departs from them in \n                many respects because of the wide differences between \n                the courts-martial process and practice in federal \n                district court.''.\n\n                f.

Definitions. Terms defined in section 601 of \n                title 5, United States Code, including the term \n                ``agency,'' shall have the same meaning in this order.\n\n                Sec. 5.

Reporting. For the purpose of promoting \n                compliance with this order, Advocacy shall submit a \n                report not less than annually to the Director of the \n                Office of Management and Budget on the extent of \n                compliance with this order by agencies.\n\n                Sec. 7. Confidentiality. Consistent with existing law, \n                Advocacy may publicly disclose information that it \n                receives from the agencies in the course of carrying \n                out this order only to the extent that such information \n                already has been lawfully and publicly disclosed by \n                OIRA or the relevant rulemaking agency.\n\n                Sec. 8.

Federal Leadership. The Federal \n                Government, as the Nation's largest energy consumer, \n                shall significantly improve its energy management in \n                order to save taxpayer dollars and reduce emissions \n                that contribute to air pollution and global climate \n                change. With more than 500,000 buildings, the Federal \n                Government can lead the Nation in energy efficient \n                building design, construction, and operation. As a \n                major consumer that spends $200 billion annually on \n                products and services, the Federal Government can \n                promote energy efficiency, water conservation, and the \n                use of renewable energy products, and help foster \n                markets for emerging technologies. In encouraging \n                effective energy management in the Federal Government, \n                this order builds on work begun under EPACT and \n                previous Executive orders.\n\n                PART 2--GOALS\n\n                Sec. 201. Greenhouse Gases Reduction Goal. Through \n                life-cycle cost-effective energy measures, each agency \n                shall reduce its greenhouse gas emissions attributed to \n                facility energy use by 30 percent by 2010 compared to \n                such emissions levels in 1990. In order to encourage \n                optimal investment in energy improvements, agencies can \n                count greenhouse gas reductions from improvements in \n                nonfacility energy use toward this goal to the extent \n                that these reductions are approved by the Office of \n                Management and Budget (OMB).\n\n                Sec. 202. Energy Efficiency Improvement Goals. Through \n                life-cycle cost-effective measures, each agency shall \n                reduce energy consumption per gross square foot of its \n                facilities, excluding facilities covered in section 203 \n                of this order, by 30 percent by 2005 and 35 percent by \n                2010 relative to 1985. No facilities will be exempt \n                from these goals unless they meet new criteria for \n                exemptions, to be issued by the Department of Energy \n                (DOE).\n\n                Sec. 203. Industrial and Laboratory Facilities. Through \n                life-cycle cost-effective measures, each agency shall \n                reduce energy consumption per square foot, per unit of \n                production, or per other unit as applicable by 20 \n                percent by 2005 and 25 percent by 2010 relative to \n                1990. No facilities will be exempt from these goals \n                unless they meet new criteria for exemptions, as issued \n                by DOE.\n\n                Sec. 204. Renewable Energy. Each agency shall strive to \n                expand the use of renewable energy within its \n                facilities and in its activities by implementing \n                renewable energy projects and by purchasing electricity \n                from renewable energy sources. In support of the \n                Million Solar Roofs initiative, the Federal Government \n                shall strive to install 2,000 solar energy systems at \n                Federal facilities by the end of 2000, and 20,000 solar \n                energy systems at Federal facilities by 2010.\n\n[[Page 30852]]\n\n                Sec. 205. Petroleum. Through life-cycle cost-effective \n                measures, each agency shall reduce the use of petroleum \n                within its facilities. Agencies may accomplish this \n                reduction by switching to a less greenhouse gas-\n                intensive, nonpetroleum energy source, such as natural \n                gas or renewable energy sources; by eliminating \n                unnecessary fuel use; or by other appropriate methods. \n                Where alternative fuels are not practical or life-cycle \n                cost-effective, agencies shall strive to improve the \n                efficiency of their facilities.\n\n                Sec. 206. Source Energy. The Federal Government shall \n                strive to reduce total energy use and associated \n                greenhouse gas and other air emissions, as measured at \n                the source. To that end, agencies shall undertake life-\n                cycle cost-effective projects in which source energy \n                decreases, even if site energy use increases. In such \n                cases, agencies will receive credit toward energy \n                reduction goals through guidelines developed by DOE.\n\n                Sec. 207. Water Conservation. Through life-cycle cost-\n                effective measures, agencies shall reduce water \n                consumption and associated energy use in their \n                facilities to reach the goals set under section 503(f) \n                of this order. Where possible, water cost savings and \n                associated energy cost savings shall be included in \n                Energy-Savings Performance Contracts and other \n                financing mechanisms.\n\n                PART 3--ORGANIZATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY\n\n                Sec. 301.

Applicability. This order applies to all \n                Federal departments and agencies. General Services \n                Administration (GSA) is responsible for working with \n                agencies to meet the requirements of this order for \n                those facilities for which GSA has delegated operations \n                and maintenance authority. The Department of Defense \n                (DOD) is subject to this order to the extent that it \n                does not impair or adversely affect military operations \n                and training (including tactical aircraft, ships, \n                weapons systems, combat training, and border security).\n\n                PART 4--PROMOTING FEDERAL LEADERSHIP IN ENERGY \n                MANAGEMENT\n\n                Sec. 401. Life-Cycle Cost Analysis. Agencies shall use \n                life-cycle cost analysis in making decisions about \n                their investments in products, services, construction, \n                and other projects to lower the Federal Government's \n                costs and to reduce energy and water consumption. Where \n                appropriate, agencies shall consider the life-cycle \n                costs of combinations of projects, particularly to \n                encourage bundling of energy efficiency projects with \n                renewable energy projects. Agencies shall also retire \n                inefficient equipment on an accelerated basis where \n                replacement results in lower life-cycle costs. Agencies \n                that minimize life-cycle costs with efficiency measures \n                will be recognized in their scorecard evaluations.\n\n                Sec. 402. Facility Energy Audits. Agencies shall \n                continue to conduct energy and water audits for \n                approximately 10 percent of their facilities each year, \n                either independentlyor through Energy-Savings \n                Performance Contracts or utility energy-efficiency \n                service contracts.\n\n                Sec. 403. Energy Management Strategies and Tools. \n                Agencies shall use a variety of energy management \n                strategies and tools, where life-cycle cost-effective, \n                to meet the goals of this order. An agency's use of \n                these strategies and tools shall be taken into account \n                in assessing the agency's progress and formulating its \n                scorecard.\n\n                    (a) Financing Mechanisms. Agencies shall maximize \n                their use of available alternative financing \n                contracting mechanisms, including Energy-Savings \n                Performance Contracts and utility energy-efficiency \n                service contracts, when life-cycle cost-effective, to \n                reduce energy use and cost in their facilities and \n                operations. Energy-Savings Performance Contracts, which \n                are authorized under the National Energy Conservation \n                Policy Act, as modified by the Energy Policy Act of \n                1992, and utility energy-efficiency service contracts \n                provide significant opportunities for making Federal \n                facilities more energy efficient at no net cost to \n                taxpayers.\n                    (b) ENERGY STAR<register> and Other Energy \n                Efficient Products.\n                      (1) Agencies shall select, where life-cycle cost-\n                effective, ENERGY STAR<register> and other energy \n                efficient products when acquiring energy-using \n                products. For product groups where ENERGY \n                STAR<register> labels are not yet available, agencies \n                shall select products that are in the upper 25 percent \n                of energy efficiency as designated by FEMP. The \n                Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and DOE shall \n                expedite the process of designating products as ENERGY \n                STAR<register> and will merge their current efficiency \n                rating procedures.\n                      (2) GSA and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), \n                with assistance from EPA and DOE, shall create clear \n                catalogue listings that designate these\n\n[[Page 30855]]\n\n                products in both print and electronic formats. In \n                addition, GSA and DLA shall undertake pilot projects \n                from selected energy-using products to show a ``second \n                price tag'', which means an accounting of the operating \n                and purchase costs of the item, in both printed and \n                electronic catalogues and assess the impact of \n                providing this information on Federal purchasing \n                decisions.\n                      (3) Agencies shall incorporate energy efficient \n                criteria consistent with ENERGY STAR<register> and \n                other FEMP-designated energy efficiency levels into all \n                guide specifications and project specifications \n                developed for new construction and renovation, as well \n                as into product specification language developed for \n                Basic Ordering Agreements, Blanket Purchasing \n                Agreements, Government Wide Acquisition Contracts, and \n                all other purchasing procedures.\n                      (4) DOE and OMB shall also explore the creation \n                of financing agreements with private sector suppliers \n                to provide private funding to offset higher up-front \n                costs of efficient products. Within 9 months of the \n                date of this order, DOE shall report back to the \n                President's Management Council on the viability of such \n                alternative financing options.\n                    (c) ENERGY STAR<register> Buildings. Agencies shall \n                strive to meet the ENERGY STAR<register> Building \n                criteria for energy performance and indoor \n                environmental quality in their eligible facilities to \n                the maximum extent practicable by the end of 2002. \n                Agencies may use Energy-Savings Performance Contracts, \n                utility energy-efficiency service contracts, or other \n                means to conduct evaluations and make improvements to \n                buildings in order to meet the criteria. Buildings that \n                rank in the top 25 percent in energy efficiency \n                relative to comparable commercial and Federal buildings \n                will receive the ENERGY STAR<register> building label. \n                Agencies shall integrate this building rating tool into \n                their general facility audits.\n                    (d) Sustainable Building Design. DOD and GSA, in \n                consultation with DOE and EPA, shall develop \n                sustainable design principles. Agencies shall apply \n                such principles to the siting, design, and construction \n                of new facilities. Agencies shall optimize life-cycle \n                costs, pollution, and other environmental and energy \n                costs associated with the construction, life-cycle \n                operation, and decommissioning of the facility. \n                Agencies shall consider using Energy-Savings \n                Performance Contracts or utility energy-efficiency \n                service contracts to aid them in constructing \n                sustainably designed buildings.\n                    (e) Model Lease Provisions. Agencies entering into \n                leases, including the renegotiation or extension of \n                existing leases, shall incorporate lease provisions \n                that encourage energy and water efficiency wherever \n                life-cycle cost-effective. Build-to-suit lease \n                solicitations shall contain criteria encouraging \n                sustainable design and development, energy efficiency, \n                and verification of building performance. Agencies \n                shall include a preference for buildings having the \n                ENERGY STAR<register> building label in their selection \n                criteria for acquiring leased buildings. In addition, \n                all agencies shall encourage lessors to apply for the \n                ENERGY STAR<register> building label and to explore and \n                implement projects that would reduce costs to the \n                Federal Government, including projects carried out \n                through the lessors' Energy-Savings Performance \n                Contracts or utility energy-efficiency service \n                contracts.\n                    (f) Industrial Facility Efficiency Improvements. \n                Agencies shall explore efficiency opportunities in \n                industrial facilities for steam systems, boiler \n                operation, air compressor systems, industrial \n                processes, and fuel switching, including cogeneration \n                and other efficiency and renewable energy technologies.\n                    (g) Highly Efficient Systems.

BUSH, President of the United States of \n                America, hereby expand the scope of the national \n                emergency declared in Executive Order 13303 of May 22, \n                2003, to address the unusual and extraordinary threat \n                to the national security and foreign policy of the \n                United States posed by obstacles to the orderly \n                reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and maintenance \n                of peace and security in that country, and the \n                development of political, administrative, and economic \n                institutions in Iraq. I find that the removal of Iraqi \n                property from that country by certain senior officials \n                of the former Iraqi regime and their immediate family \n                members constitutes one of these obstacles. I further \n                determine that the United States is engaged in armed \n                hostilities and that it is in the interest of the \n                United States to confiscate certain additional property \n                of the former Iraqi regime, certain senior officials of \n                the former regime, immediate family members of those \n                officials, and controlled entities. I intend that such \n                property, after all right, title, and interest in it \n                has vested in the Department of the Treasury, shall be \n                transferred to the Development Fund for Iraq. Such \n                property shall be used to meet the humanitarian needs \n                of the Iraqi people, for the economic reconstruction \n                and repair of Iraq's infrastructure, for the continued \n                disarmament of Iraq, for the costs of Iraqi civilian \n                administration, and for other purposes benefiting the \n                Iraqi people. I determine that such use would be in the \n                interest of and for the benefit of the United States. I \n                hereby order:\n\n                Section 1.

The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State, is authorized to \n                confiscate property that is blocked pursuant to section \n                1 of this order and that he determines, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State, to belong to a person, \n                organization, or country that has planned, authorized, \n                aided, or engaged in armed hostilities against the \n                United States. All right, title, and interest in any \n                property so confiscated shall vest in the Department of \n                the Treasury. Such vested property shall promptly be \n                transferred to the Development Fund for Iraq.\n\n                Sec. 3.

For purposes of this order:\n\n                    (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or \n                entity;\n                    (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, \n                association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, \n                subgroup, or other organization;\n                    (c) the term ``United States person'' means any \n                United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity \n                organized under the laws of the United States or any \n                jurisdiction within the United States (including \n                foreign branches), or any person in the United States;\n                    (d) the term ``former Iraqi regime'' means the \n                Saddam Hussein regime that governed Iraq until on or \n                about May 1, 2003;\n                    (e) the term ``coalition authority'' means the \n                Coalition Provisional Authority under the direction of \n                its Administrator, and the military forces of the \n                United States, the United Kingdom, and their coalition \n                partners present in Iraq under the command or \n                operational control of the Commander of United States \n                Central Command; and\n                    (f) the term ``Development Fund for Iraq'' means \n                the fund established on or about May 22, 2003, on the \n                books of the Central Bank of Iraq, by the Administrator \n                of the Coalition Provisional Authority responsible for \n                the temporary governance of Iraq and all accounts held \n                for the fund or for the Central Bank of Iraq in the \n                name of the fund.\n\n                Sec. 5. I hereby determine that the making of donations \n                of the type specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 \n                U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by or to persons determined to be \n                subject to the sanctions imposed under this order would \n                seriously impair my ability to deal with the national \n                emergency declared in Executive Order 13303 and \n                expanded in scope in this order and would endanger \n                Armed Forces of the United States that are engaged in \n                hostilities, and I hereby prohibit such donations as \n                provided by section 1 of this order.\n\n                Sec. 6. For those persons listed in the Annex to this \n                order or determined to be subject to this order who \n                might have a constitutional presence in the United \n                States, I find that because of the ability to transfer \n                funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to \n                such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this \n                order would render these measures ineffectual. I \n                therefore determine that for these measures to be \n                effective in addressing the national emergency declared \n                in Executive Order 13303 and expanded in scope in this \n                order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or \n                determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.\n\n                Sec. 7. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to \n                take such actions, including the promulgation of rules \n                and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to \n                the President by IEEPA and UNPA as may be necessary to \n                carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of \n                the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to \n                other officers and agencies of the United States \n                Government, consistent with applicable law. All \n                agencies of the United States Government\n\n[[Page 52317]]\n\n                are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures \n                within their authority to carry out the provisions of \n                this order.\n\n                Sec. 8. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State, is authorized to \n                determine, subsequent to the issuance of this order, \n                that circumstances no longer warrant inclusion of a \n                person in the Annex to this order and that such person \n                is therefore no longer covered within the scope of the \n                order.\n\n                Sec. 9. Nothing in this order is intended to affect the \n                continued effectiveness of any rules, regulations, \n                orders, licenses, or other forms of administrative \n                action issued, taken, or continued in effect heretofore \n                or hereafter under 31 C.F.R. chapter V, except as \n                expressly terminated, modified, or suspended by or \n                pursuant to this order.\n\n                Sec. 10. This order shall not apply to such property as \n                is or may come under the control of the coalition \n                authority in Iraq. Nothing in this order is intended to \n                affect dispositions of such property or other \n                determinations by the coalition authority.\n\n                Sec. 11. This order is not intended to, and does not, \n                create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, \n                enforceable at law or in equity by any party against \n                the United States, its departments, agencies, \n                instrumentalities, or entities, officers or employees, \n                or any other person.\n\n                Sec. 12. This order is effective on 12:01 a.m. EDT on \n                August 29, 2003.\n\n                Sec. 13.

For the Federal \n                courts to function effectively, judicial vacancies in \n                those courts must be filled in a timely manner with \n                well-qualified candidates.\n\n                Sec. 2.

Reservation of Authority. Nothing in this order \n                shall be construed to affect the authority of the \n                President to fill vacancies under clause 3 of section 2 \n                of article II of the Constitution.\n\n                Sec. 5.

For the purposes of this order:\n                     (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or \n                entity;\n                     (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, \n                association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, \n                subgroup, or other organization; and\n                     (c) the term ``United States person'' means any \n                United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity \n                organized under the laws of the United States or any \n                jurisdiction within the United States (including \n                foreign branches), or any person in the United States.\n                    Sec. 4. For those persons whose property and \n                interests in property are blocked pursuant to this \n                order who might have a constitutional presence in the \n                United States, I find that, because of the ability to \n                transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior \n                notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant \n                to this order would render these measures ineffectual. \n                I therefore determine that, for these measures to be \n                effective in addressing the national emergency declared \n                in this order, there need be no prior notice of a \n                listing or determination made pursuant to section 1(a) \n                of this order.\n                    Sec. 5. The Secretary of the Treasury, in \n                consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby \n                authorized to take such actions, including the \n                promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ \n                all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be \n                necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The \n                Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these \n                functions to other officers and agencies of the United \n                States Government, consistent with applicable law. All \n                agencies of the United States Government are hereby \n                directed to take all appropriate measures within their \n                authority to carry out the provisions of this order \n                and, where appropriate, to advise the Secretary of the \n                Treasury in a timely manner of the measures taken.\n                    Sec. 6. The Secretary of the Treasury, in \n                consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby \n                authorized to determine, subsequent to the issuance of \n                this order, that circumstances no longer warrant the \n                inclusion of a person in the Annex to this order and \n                that the property and interests in property of that \n                person are therefore no longer blocked pursuant to \n                section 1(a) of this order.\n                    Sec. 7. This order is not intended to create, nor \n                does it create, any right, benefit, or privilege, \n                substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in \n                equity by any party against the United States, its \n                departments, agencies, instrumentalities, or entities, \n                its officers or employees, or any other person.''\n\n                Sec. 3. This order is not intended to create, nor does \n                it create, any right, benefit, or privilege, \n                substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in \n                equity by any party against the United States, its \n                departments, agencies, instrumentalities, or entities, \n                its officers or employees, or any other person.\n\n                Sec. 4.

Policy. Military personnel deployed in \n                particular military operations could potentially be \n                exposed to a range of chemical, biological, and \n                radiological weapons as well as diseases endemic to an \n                area of operations. It is the policy of the United \n                States Government to provide our military personnel \n                with safe and effective vaccines, antidotes, and \n                treatments that will negate or minimize the effects of \n                these health threats.\n\n                Sec. 2. Administration of Investigational New Drugs to \n                Members of the Armed Forces.\n\n                    (a) The Secretary of Defense (Secretary) shall \n                collect intelligence on potential health threats that \n                might be encountered in an area of operations. The \n                Secretary shall work together with the Secretary of \n                Health and Human Services to ensure appropriate \n                countermeasures are developed. When the Secretary \n                considers an investigational new drug or a drug \n                unapproved for its intended use (investigational drug) \n                to represent the most appropriate countermeasure, it \n                shall be studied through scientifically based research \n                and development protocols to determine whether it is \n                safe and effective for its intended use.\n                    (b) It is the expectation that the United States \n                Government will administer products approved for their \n                intended use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). \n                However, in the event that the Secretary considers a \n                product to represent the most appropriate \n                countermeasure for diseases endemic to the area of \n                operations or to protect against possible chemical, \n                biological, or radiological weapons, but the product \n                has not yet been approved by the FDA for its intended \n                use, the product may, under certain circumstances and \n                strict controls, be administered to provide potential \n                protection for the health and well-being of deployed \n                military personnel in order to ensure the success of \n                the military operation. The provisions of 21 CFR Part \n                312 contain the FDA requirements for investigational \n                new drugs.\n\n                Sec. 3. Informed Consent Requirements and Waiver \n                Provisions.\n\n                    (a) Before administering an investigational drug to \n                members of the Armed Forces, the Department of Defense \n                (DoD) must obtain informed consent from each individual \n                unless the Secretary can justify to the President a \n                need for a waiver of informed consent in accordance \n                with 10 U.S.C. 1107(f). Waivers of informed consent \n                will be granted only when absolutely necessary.\n                    (b) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 1107(f), the \n                President may waive the informed consent requirement \n                for the administration of an investigational drug to a \n                member of the Armed Forces in connection with the \n                member's participation in a particular military \n                operation, upon a written determination by the \n                President that obtaining consent:\n                    L(1) is not feasible;\n                    L(2) is contrary to the best interests of the \n                member; or\n                    L(3) is not in the interests of national security.\n\n[[Page 54176]]\n\n                    (c) In making a determination to waive the informed \n                consent requirement on a ground described in subsection \n                (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, the President is \n                required by law to apply the standards and criteria set \n                forth in the relevant FDA regulations, 21 CFR 50.23(d). \n                In determining a waiver based on subsection (b)(3) of \n                this section, the President will also consider the \n                standards and criteria of the relevant FDA regulations.\n                    (d) The Secretary may request that the President \n                waive the informed consent requirement with respect to \n                the administration of an investigational drug. The \n                Secretary may not delegate the authority to make this \n                waiver request. At a minimum, the waiver request shall \n                contain:\n                    L(1) A full description of the threat, including \n                the potential for exposure. If the threat is a \n                chemical, biological, or radiological weapon, the \n                waiver request shall contain an analysis of the \n                probability the weapon will be used, the method or \n                methods of delivery, and the likely magnitude of its \n                affect on an exposed individual.\n                    L(2) Documentation that the Secretary has complied \n                with 21 CFR 50.23(d). This documentation shall include:\n\n                  L(A) A statement that certifies and a written \n                    justification that documents that each of the \n                    criteria and standards set forth in 21 CFR 50.23(d) \n                    has been met; or\n\n                  L(B) If the Secretary finds it highly impracticable \n                    to certify that the criteria and standards set \n                    forth in 21 CFR 50.23(d) have been fully met \n                    because doing so would significantly impair the \n                    Secretary's ability to carry out the particular \n                    military mission, a written justification that \n                    documents which criteria and standards have or have \n                    not been met, explains the reasons for failing to \n                    meet any of the criteria and standards, and \n                    provides additional justification why a waiver \n                    should be granted solely in the interests of \n                    national security.\n\n                    L(3) Any additional information pertinent to the \n                Secretary's determination, including the minutes of the \n                Institutional Review Board's (IRB) deliberations and \n                the IRB members' voting record.\n                    (e) The Secretary shall develop the waiver request \n                in consultation with the FDA.\n                    (f) The Secretary shall submit the waiver request \n                to the President and provide a copy to the Commissioner \n                of the FDA (Commissioner).\n                    (g) The Commissioner shall expeditiously review the \n                waiver request and certify to the Assistant to the \n                President for National Security Affairs (APNSA) and the \n                Assistant to the President for Science and Technology \n                (APST) whether the standards and criteria of the \n                relevant FDA regulations have been adequately addressed \n                and whether the investigational new drug protocol may \n                proceed subject to a decision by the President on the \n                informed consent waiver request. FDA shall base its \n                decision on, and the certification shall include an \n                analysis describing, the extent and strength of the \n                evidence on the safety and effectiveness of the \n                investigational new drug in relation to the medical \n                risk that could be encountered during the military \n                operation.\n                    (h) The APNSA and APST will prepare a joint \n                advisory opinion as to whether the waiver of informed \n                consent should be granted and will forward it, along \n                with the waiver request and the FDA certification to \n                the President.\n                    (i) The President will approve or deny the waiver \n                request and will provide written notification of the \n                decision to the Secretary and the Commissioner.\n\n[[Page 54177]]\n\n                Sec. 4. Required Action After Waiver is Issued. (a) \n                Following a Presidential waiver under 10 U.S.C. \n                1107(f), the DoD offices responsible for implementing \n                the waiver, DoD's Office of the Inspector General, and \n                the FDA, consistent with its regulatory role, will \n                conduct an ongoing review and monitoring to assess \n                adherence to the standards and criteria under 21 CFR \n                50.23(d) and this order. The responsible DoD offices \n                shall also adhere to any periodic reporting \n                requirements specified by the President at the time of \n                the waiver approval. The Secretary shall submit the \n                findings to the President and provide a copy to the \n                Commissioner.\n\n                    (b) The Secretary shall, as soon as practicable, \n                make the congressional notifications required by 10 \n                U.S.C. 1107(f)(2)(B).\n                    (c) The Secretary shall, as soon as practicable and \n                consistent with classification requirements, issue a \n                public notice in the Federal Register describing each \n                waiver of informed consent determination and a summary \n                of the most updated scientific information on the \n                products used, as well as other information the \n                President determines is appropriate.\n                    (d) The waiver will expire at the end of 1 year (or \n                an alternative time period not to exceed 1 year, \n                specified by the President at the time of approval), or \n                when the Secretary informs the President that the \n                particular military operation creating the need for the \n                use of the investigational drug has ended, whichever is \n                earlier. The President may revoke the waiver based on \n                changed circumstances or for any other reason. If the \n                Secretary seeks to renew a waiver prior to its \n                expiration, the Secretary must submit to the President \n                an updated request, specifically identifying any new \n                information available relevant to the standards and \n                criteria under 21 CFR 50.23(d). To request to renew a \n                waiver, the Secretary must satisfy the criteria for a \n                waiver as described in section 3 of this order.\n                    (e) The Secretary shall notify the President and \n                the Commissioner if the threat countered by the \n                investigational drug changes significantly or if \n                significant new information on the investigational drug \n                is received.\n\n                Sec. 5. Training for Military Personnel. (a) The DoD \n                shall provide ongoing training and health risk \n                communication on the requirements of using an \n                investigational drug in support of a military operation \n                to all military personnel, including those in \n                leadership positions, during chemical and biological \n                warfare defense training and other training, as \n                appropriate. This ongoing training and health risk \n                communication shall include general information about \n                10 U.S.C. 1107 and 21 CFR 50.23(d).\n\n                    (b) If the President grants a waiver under 10 \n                U.S.C. 1107(f), the DoD shall provide training to all \n                military personnel conducting the waiver protocol and \n                health risk communication to all military personnel \n                receiving the specific investigational drug to be \n                administered prior to its use.\n                    (c) The Secretary shall submit the training and \n                health risk communication plans as part of the \n                investigational new drug protocol submission to the FDA \n                and the reviewing IRB. Training and health risk \n                communication shall include at a minimum:\n                    L(1) The basis for any determination by the \n                President that informed consent is not or may not be \n                feasible;\n                    L(2) The means for tracking use and adverse effects \n                of the investigational drug;\n                    L(3) The benefits and risks of using the \n                investigational drug; and\n                    L(4) A statement that the investigational drug is \n                not approved (or not approved for the intended use).\n                    (d) The DoD shall keep operational commanders \n                informed of the overall requirements of successful \n                protocol execution and their role, with the support of \n                medical personnel, in ensuring successful execution of \n                the protocol.\n\n                Sec. 6.
