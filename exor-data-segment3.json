Federal Leadership. The purpose of this \n                order is to ensure that the Federal Government \n                exercises leadership in the reduction of petroleum \n                consumption through improvements in fleet fuel \n                efficiency and the use of alternative fuel vehicles \n                (AFVs) and alternative fuels. Reduced petroleum use and \n                the displacement of petroleum by alternative fuels will \n                help promote markets for more alternative fuel and fuel \n                efficient vehicles, encourage new technologies, enhance \n                the United States' energy self-sufficiency and \n                security, and ensure a healthier environment through \n                the reduction of greenhouse gases and other pollutants \n                in the atmosphere.\n\n                PART 2  GOALS\n\n                Sec. 201. Reduced Petroleum Fuel Consumption. Each \n                agency operating 20 or more motor vehicles within the \n                United States shall reduce its entire vehicle fleet's \n                annual petroleum consumption by at least 20 percent by \n                the end of FY 2005, compared with FY 1999 petroleum \n                consumption levels.\n\n                Sec. 202. Performance Strategies. Agencies have \n                numerous options for developing a strategy to meet the \n                petroleum reduction levels established in section 201 \n                of this order. Measures include: the use of alternative \n                fuels in light, medium, and heavy-duty vehicles; the \n                acquisition of vehicles with higher fuel economy, \n                including hybrid vehicles; the substitution of cars for \n                light trucks; an increase in vehicle load factors; a \n                decrease in vehicle miles traveled; and a decrease in \n                fleet size. Each agency will need a strategy that \n                includes most, if not all, of these measures, but can \n                develop a strategy that fits its unique fleet \n                configuration and mission requirements. As part of the \n                strategy, each agency should attempt to accelerate the \n                introduction of vehicles meeting Tier 2 standards. \n                Where feasible, agencies should also consider \n                procurement of innovative vehicles, such as hybrid \n                electric vehicles, capable of large improvements in \n                fuel economy. The strategy should also attempt to \n                minimize costs in achieving the objectives of this \n                order. In developing its strategy, each agency shall \n                include the following:\n\n                    (a) AFV Acquisition and Use of Alternative Fuels. \n                Each agency shall fulfill the acquisition requirements \n                for AFVs established by section 303 of the Energy \n                Policy Act of 1992. Agencies shall use alternative \n                fuels to meet a majority of the fuel requirements of \n                those motor vehicles by the end of FY 2005. Section 402 \n                of this order addresses related issues of alternative \n                fuel infrastructure availability and the ability to \n                track alternative fuel usage data; and\n                    (b) Acquisition of Higher Fuel Economy Vehicles. \n                Agencies shall increase the average EPA fuel economy \n                rating of passenger cars and light trucks acquired by \n                at least 1 mile per gallon (mpg) by the end of FY 2002 \n                and at least 3 mpg by the end of FY 2005 compared to FY \n                1999 acquisitions.\n\n[[Page 24608]]\n\n                PART 3  ORGANIZATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY\n\n                Sec. 301.

To support the use of \n                alternative fuel in AFVs, agencies should arrange for \n                fueling at commercial facilities that offer alternative \n                fuels for sale to the public.\n\n                    (a) Agencies should team with State, local, and \n                private entities to support the expansion and use of \n                public access alternative fuel refueling stations;\n\n[[Page 24610]]\n\n                    (b) Agencies should use the authority granted to \n                them in section 304 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to \n                establish nonpublic access alternative fuel \n                infrastructure for fueling Federal AFVs where public \n                fueling is unavailable.\n                    (c) Agencies are encouraged to work with DOE and \n                GSA to resolve alternative fuel usage tracking issues \n                with alternative and petroleum fuel providers.\n\n                Sec. 403. Procurement of Environmentally Preferable \n                Motor Vehicle Products.\n\n                    (a) Consistent with Executive Order 13101 and \n                section 6002 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery \n                Act (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. 6962, effective 6 months after \n                the date of this order, no Federal agency shall \n                purchase, sell, or arrange for the purchase of virgin \n                petroleum motor vehicle lubricating oils when re-\n                refined motor vehicle lubricating oils are reasonably \n                available and meet the vehicle manufacturer's \n                recommended performance standards.\n                    (b) Consistent with Executive Order 13101 and RCRA \n                section 6962, in acquiring and maintaining motor \n                vehicles, agencies shall acquire and use United States \n                EPA-designated Comprehensive Procurement Guideline \n                items, including but not limited to retread tires, when \n                such products are reasonably available and meet \n                applicable performance standards. In addition, Federal \n                agencies should consider acquiring other recycled \n                content products, such as tires containing a minimum of \n                5-10 percent post-consumer recovered rubber.\n                    (c) Consistent with Executive Order 13101, Federal \n                agencies are encouraged to use biobased motor vehicle \n                products when such products are reasonably available \n                and meet applicable performance standards.\n\n                PART 5  GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n                Sec. 501. Revocation. Executive Order 13031 of December \n                13, 1996, is revoked.\n\n                Sec. 502. Statutory Authority. Agencies must carry out \n                the provisions of this order to the extent consistent \n                with their statutory authority.\n\n                Sec. 503. Limitations. This order is intended only to \n                improve the internal management of the executive branch \n                and is not intended to create any right, benefit, or \n                trust responsibility, substantive or procedural, \n                enforceable at law by a party against the United \n                States, its agencies, its officers, or any other \n                person.\n\n                Sec. 504. Independent Agencies. Independent agencies \n                and agencies excepted from coverage by section 304 are \n                encouraged to comply with the provisions of this order.\n\n                Sec. 505. Government-Owned Contractor-Operated \n                Vehicles. Agencies must ensure that all Government-\n                owned contractor-operated vehicles comply with all \n                applicable goals and other requirements of this order \n                and that these goals and requirements are incorporated \n                into each contractor's management contract.\n\n                Sec. 506. Exemptions for Military Tactical, Law \n                Enforcement, and Emergency Vehicles. Department of \n                Defense military tactical vehicles are exempt from this \n                order. Law enforcement, emergency, and any other \n                vehicle class or type determined by OMB, in \n                consultation with DOE, are exempted from this order's \n                requirements for Federal fleet fuel efficiency and \n                alternative fuel vehicle acquisition. Agencies claiming \n                vehicle exemptions must provide information on the \n                number of each class or type of vehicle claimed as \n                exempt as well as an estimate of total fuel consumption \n                of exempt vehicles on an annual basis. Agencies should \n                examine options for increasing fuel efficiency in these \n                exempt vehicles and should report actions taken to \n                increase fuel efficiency in these vehicles or fleets. \n                All information required by this section must be \n                submitted annually under Part 3 of this order.\n\n                Sec. 507. Compliance. (a) If an agency fails to meet \n                requirements of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 or this \n                order, its report to the DOE and OMB\n\n[[Page 24611]]\n\n                under section 302(c) must include an explanation for \n                such failure and an updated strategy for achieving \n                compliance using the agency's current and requested \n                budgets.\n\n                    (b) OMB, in consultation with DOE, may modify the \n                compliance requirements for an agency under Part 2 of \n                this order, if the agency is unable to comply with the \n                requirements of that part. An agency requesting \n                modification must show that it has made substantial \n                good faith efforts to comply with that part. The \n                availability and costs of alternative fuels and AFVs \n                can be a factor in OMB's decision to modify the \n                agency's compliance with Part 2 of this order.\n\n                Sec. 508. Definitions. Terms used in this order shall \n                have the same definitions as those in the Energy Policy \n                Act of 1992 and Executive Order 13101, unless \n                specifically changed in guidance to be issued by DOE \n                under section 301(b) of this order.\n\n                    (Presidential Sig.)<clinton1><clinton2>\n\n                THE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n                    April 21, 2000.\n\n[FR Doc. 00-10551\nFiled 4-25-00; 8:45 am]\nBilling code 3195-01-P\n\n\n</clinton2></clinton1></pre>]","url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2000/04/26/00-10551/greening-the-government-through-federal-fleet-and","president":"clinton","id":"13149"},"reftime":1418257605843}

Policy.\n\n                    (a) The effective functioning of our constitutional \n                democracy depends upon the participation in public life \n                of a citizenry that is well informed. For nearly four \n                decades, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) has \n                provided an important means through which the public \n                can obtain information regarding the activities of \n                Federal agencies. Under the FOIA, the public can obtain \n                records from any Federal agency, subject to the \n                exemptions enacted by the Congress to protect \n                information that must be held in confidence for the \n                Government to function effectively or for other \n                purposes.\n                    (b) FOIA requesters are seeking a service from the \n                Federal Government and should be treated as such. \n                Accordingly, in responding to a FOIA request, agencies \n                shall respond courteously and appropriately. Moreover, \n                agencies shall provide FOIA requesters, and the public \n                in general, with citizen-centered ways to learn about \n                the FOIA process, about agency records that are \n                publicly available (e.g., on the agency's website), and \n                about the status of a person's FOIA request and \n                appropriate information about the agency's response.\n                    (c) Agency FOIA operations shall be both results-\n                oriented and produce results. Accordingly, agencies \n                shall process requests under the FOIA in an efficient \n                and appropriate manner and achieve tangible, measurable \n                improvements in FOIA processing. When an agency's FOIA \n                program does not produce such results, it should be \n                reformed, consistent with available resources \n                appropriated by the Congress and applicable law, to \n                increase efficiency and better reflect the policy goals \n                and objectives of this order.\n                    (d) A citizen-centered and results-oriented \n                approach will improve service and performance, thereby \n                strengthening compliance with the FOIA, and will help \n                avoid disputes and related litigation.\n\n                Sec. 2. Agency Chief FOIA Officers.\n\n                    (a) Designation. The head of each agency shall \n                designate within 30 days of the date of this order a \n                senior official of such agency (at the Assistant \n                Secretary or equivalent level), to serve as the Chief \n                FOIA Officer of that agency. The head of the agency \n                shall promptly notify the Director of the Office of \n                Management and Budget (OMB Director) and the Attorney \n                General of such designation and of any changes \n                thereafter in such designation.\n                    (b) General Duties. The Chief FOIA Officer of each \n                agency shall, subject to the authority of the head of \n                the agency:\n\n(i) have agency-wide responsibility for efficient and appropriate \ncompliance with the FOIA;\n\n(ii) monitor FOIA implementation throughout the agency, including through \nthe use of meetings with the public to the extent deemed appropriate by the \nagency's Chief FOIA Officer, and keep the head of the agency, the chief \nlegal officer of the agency, and the Attorney General appropriately \ninformed of the agency's performance in implementing the FOIA, including \nthe extent to which the agency meets the milestones\n\n[[Page 75374]]\n\nin the agency's plan under section 3(b) of this order and training and \nreporting standards established consistent with applicable law and this \norder;\n\n(iii) recommend to the head of the agency such adjustments to agency \npractices, policies, personnel, and funding as may be necessary to carry \nout the policy set forth in section 1 of this order;\n\n(iv) review and report, through the head of the agency, at such times and \nin such formats as the Attorney General may direct, on the agency's \nperformance in implementing the FOIA; and\n\n(v) facilitate public understanding of the purposes of the FOIA's statutory \nexemptions by including concise descriptions of the exemptions in both the \nagency's FOIA handbook issued under section 552(g) of title 5, United \nStates Code, and the agency's annual FOIA report, and by providing an \noverview, where appropriate, of certain general categories of agency \nrecords to which those exemptions apply.\n\n                    (c) FOIA Requester Service Center and FOIA Public \n                Liaisons. In order to ensure appropriate communication \n                with FOIA requesters:\n\n(i) Each agency shall establish one or more FOIA Requester Service Centers \n(Center), as appropriate, which shall serve as the first place that a FOIA \nrequester can contact to seek information concerning the status of the \nperson's FOIA request and appropriate information about the agency's FOIA \nresponse. The Center shall include appropriate staff to receive and respond \nto inquiries from FOIA requesters;\n\n(ii) The agency Chief FOIA Officer shall designate one or more agency \nofficials, as appropriate, as FOIA Public Liaisons, who may serve in the \nCenter or who may serve in a separate office. FOIA Public Liaisons shall \nserve as supervisory officials to whom a FOIA requester can raise concerns \nabout the service the FOIA requester has received from the Center, \nfollowing an initial response from the Center staff. FOIA Public Liaisons \nshall seek to ensure a service-oriented response to FOIA requests and FOIA-\nrelated inquiries. For example, the FOIA Public Liaison shall assist, as \nappropriate, in reducing delays, increasing transparency and understanding \nof the status of requests, and resolving disputes. FOIA Public Liaisons \nshall report to the agency Chief FOIA Officer on their activities and shall \nperform their duties consistent with applicable law and agency regulations;\n\n(iii) In addition to the services to FOIA requesters provided by the Center \nand FOIA Public Liaisons, the agency Chief FOIA Officer shall also consider \nwhat other FOIA-related assistance to the public should appropriately be \nprovided by the agency;\n\n(iv) In establishing the Centers and designating FOIA Public Liaisons, the \nagency shall use, as appropriate, existing agency staff and resources. A \nCenter shall have appropriate staff to receive and respond to inquiries \nfrom FOIA requesters;\n\n(v) As determined by the agency Chief FOIA Officer, in consultation with \nthe FOIA Public Liaisons, each agency shall post appropriate information \nabout its Center or Centers on the agency's website, including contact \ninformation for its FOIA Public Liaisons. In the case of an agency without \na website, the agency shall publish the information on the Firstgov.gov \nwebsite or, in the case of any agency with neither a website nor the \ncapability to post on the Firstgov.gov website, in the Federal Register; \nand\n\n(vi) The agency Chief FOIA Officer shall ensure that the agency has in \nplace a method (or methods), including through the use of the Center, to \nreceive and respond promptly and appropriately to inquiries from FOIA \nrequesters about the status of their requests. The Chief FOIA Officer shall\n\n[[Page 75375]]\n\nalso consider, in consultation with the FOIA Public Liaisons, as \nappropriate, whether the agency's implementation of other means (such as \ntracking numbers for requests, or an agency telephone or Internet hotline) \nwould be appropriate for responding to status inquiries.\n\n                Sec. 3. Review, Plan, and Report.\n\n                    (a) Review. Each agency's Chief FOIA Officer shall \n                conduct a review of the agency's FOIA operations to \n                determine whether agency practices are consistent with \n                the policies set forth in section 1 of this order. In \n                conducting this review, the Chief FOIA Officer shall:\n\n(i) evaluate, with reference to numerical and statistical benchmarks where \nappropriate, the agency's administration of the FOIA, including the \nagency's expenditure of resources on FOIA compliance and the extent to \nwhich, if any, requests for records have not been responded to within the \nstatutory time limit (backlog);\n\n(ii) review the processes and practices by which the agency assists and \ninforms the public regarding the FOIA process;\n\n(iii) examine the agency's:\n\n(A) use of information technology in responding to FOIA requests, including \nwithout limitation the tracking of FOIA requests and communication with \nrequesters;\n\n(B) practices with respect to requests for expedited processing; and\n\n(C) implementation of multi-track processing if used by such agency;\n\n(iv) review the agency's policies and practices relating to the \navailability of public information through websites and other means, \nincluding the use of websites to make available the records described in \nsection 552(a)(2) of title 5, United States Code; and\n\n(v) identify ways to eliminate or reduce its FOIA backlog, consistent with \navailable resources and taking into consideration the volume and complexity \nof the FOIA requests pending with the agency.\n\n                    (b) Plan.\n\n(i) Each agency's Chief FOIA Officer shall develop, in consultation as \nappropriate with the staff of the agency (including the FOIA Public \nLiaisons), the Attorney General, and the OMB Director, an agency-specific \nplan to ensure that the agency's administration of the FOIA is in \naccordance with applicable law and the policies set forth in section 1 of \nthis order. The plan, which shall be submitted to the head of the agency \nfor approval, shall address the agency's implementation of the FOIA during \nfiscal years 2006 and 2007.\n\n(ii) The plan shall include specific activities that the agency will \nimplement to eliminate or reduce the agency's FOIA backlog, including (as \napplicable) changes that will make the processing of FOIA requests more \nstreamlined and effective, as well as increased reliance on the \ndissemination of records that can be made available to the public through a \nwebsite or other means that do not require the public to make a request for \nthe records under the FOIA.\n\n(iii) The plan shall also include activities to increase public awareness \nof FOIA processing, including as appropriate, expanded use of the agency's \nCenter and its FOIA Public Liaisons.\n\n(iv) The plan shall also include, taking appropriate account of the \nresources available to the agency and the mission of the agency, concrete \nmilestones, with specific timetables and outcomes to be achieved, by which \nthe head of the agency, after consultation with the OMB Director, shall \nmeasure and evaluate the agency's success in the implementation of the \nplan.\n\n                    (c) Agency Reports to the Attorney General and OMB \n                Director.\n\n(i) The head of each agency shall submit a report, no later than 6 months \nfrom the date of this order, to the Attorney General and the OMB Director \nthat summarizes the results of the review under section 3(a) of this order \nand encloses a copy of the agency's plan under section 3(b) of this order.\n\n[[Page 75376]]\n\nThe agency shall publish a copy of the agency's report on the agency's \nwebsite or, in the case of an agency without a website, on the Firstgov.gov \nwebsite, or, in the case of any agency with neither a website nor the \ncapability to publish on the Firstgov.gov website, in the Federal Register.\n\n(ii) The head of each agency shall include in the agency's annual FOIA \nreports for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 a report on the agency's development \nand implementation of its plan under section 3(b) of this order and on the \nagency's performance in meeting the milestones set forth in that plan, \nconsistent with any related guidelines the Attorney General may issue under \nsection 552(e) of title 5, United States Code.\n\n(iii) If the agency does not meet a milestone in its plan, the head of the \nagency shall:\n\n(A) identify this deficiency in the annual FOIA report to the Attorney \nGeneral;\n\n(B) explain in the annual report the reasons for the agency's failure to \nmeet the milestone;\n\n(C) outline in the annual report the steps that the agency has already \ntaken, and will be taking, to address the deficiency; and\n\n(D) report this deficiency to the President's Management Council.\n\n                Sec. 4. Attorney General.\n\n                    (a) Report.

Policy. Since 1993, this Administration has \n                sought to raise standards for students and to increase \n                accountability in public education while investing more \n                resources in elementary and secondary schools. While \n                much has been accomplished--there has been progress in \n                math and reading achievement, particularly for low-\n                achieving students and students in our highest poverty \n                schools--much more can be done, especially for low-\n                performing schools.\n\n                Sec. 2. Technical Assistance and Capacity Building. (a) \n                The Secretary of Education (``Secretary'') shall work \n                with State and local educational agencies (``LEAs'') to \n                develop and implement a comprehensive strategy for \n                providing technical assistance and other assistance to \n                States and LEAs to strengthen their capacity to improve \n                the performance of schools identified as low \n                performing. This comprehensive strategy shall include a \n                number of steps, such as:\n\n(1) providing States, school districts, and schools receiving funds from \nthe school improvement fund established by Public Law 106-113, as well as \nother districts and schools identified for school improvement or corrective \naction under Title I of the ESEA, with access to the latest research and \ninformation on best practices, including research on instruction and \neducator professional development, and with the opportunity to learn from \nexemplary schools and exemplary State and local intervention strategies and \nfrom each other, in order to improve achievement for all students in the \nlow-performing schools;\n\n(2) determining effective ways of providing low-performing schools with \naccess to resources from other Department of Education programs, such as \nfunds from the Comprehensive School Reform Demonstration Program, the \nReading Excellence Act, the Eisenhower Professional Development Program, \nthe Class Size Reduction Program, and the 21st Century Community Learning \nCenters Program, and to make effective use of these funds and Title I \nfunds;\n\n(3) providing States and LEAs with information on effective strategies to \nimprove the quality of the teaching force, including strategies for \nrecruiting and retaining highly qualified teachers in high-poverty schools, \nand implementing research-based professional development programs aligned \nwith challenging standards;\n\n(4) helping States and school districts build partnerships with technical \nassistance providers, including, but not limited to, federally funded \nlaboratories and centers, foundations, businesses, community-based \norganizations, institutions of higher education, reform model providers, \nand other organizations that can help local schools improve;\n\n[[Page 26476]]\n\n(5) identifying previously low-performing schools that have made \nsignificant achievement gains, and States and school districts that have \nbeen effective in improving the achievement of all students in low-\nperforming schools, which can serve as models and resources;\n\n(6) providing assistance and information on how to effectively involve \nparents in the school-improvement process, including effectively involving \nand informing parents at the beginning of the school year about improvement \ngoals for their school as well as the goals for their own children, and \nreporting on progress made in achieving these goals;\n\n(7) providing States and LEAs with information on effective approaches to \nschool accountability, including the effectiveness of such strategies as \nschool reconstitution, peer review teams, and financial rewards and \nincentives;\n\n(8) providing LEAs with information and assistance on the design and \nimplementation of approaches to choice among public schools that create \nincentives for improvement throughout the local educational agency, \nespecially in the lowest-performing schools, and that maximize the \nopportunity of students in low-performing schools to attend a higher-\nperforming public school;\n\n(9) exploring the use of well-trained tutors to raise student achievement \nthrough initiatives such as ``America Reads,'' ``America Counts,'' and \nother work-study opportunities to help low-performing schools;\n\n(10) using a full range of strategies for disseminating information about \neffective practices, including interactive electronic communications;\n\n(11) working with the Department of Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs \n(BIA), to provide technical assistance to BIA-funded low-performing \nschools; and\n\n(12) taking other steps that can help improve the quality of teaching and \ninstruction in low-performing schools.\n\n                    (b) The Secretary shall, to the extent permitted by \n                law, take whatever steps the Secretary finds necessary \n                and appropriate to redirect the resources and technical \n                assistance capability of the Department of Education \n                (``Department'') to assist States and localities in \n                improving low-performing schools, and to ensure that \n                the dissemination of research to help turn around low-\n                performing schools is a priority of the Department.\n\n                Sec. 3. School Improvement Report. To monitor the \n                progress of LEAs and schools in turning around failing \n                schools, including those receiving grants from the \n                School Improvement Fund, the Secretary shall prepare an \n                annual School Improvement Report, to be published in \n                September of each year, beginning in 2000. The report \n                shall:\n\n                    (a) describe trends in the numbers of LEAs and \n                schools identified as needing improvement and \n                subsequent changes in the academic performance of their \n                students;\n                    (b) identify best practices and significant \n                research findings that can be used to help turn around \n                low-performing LEAs and schools; and\n                    (c) document ongoing efforts as a result of this \n                order and other Federal efforts to assist States and \n                local school districts in intervening in low-performing \n                schools, including improving teacher quality. This \n                report shall be publicly accessible.\n\n                Sec. 4. Compliance Monitoring System. Consistent with \n                the implementation of the School Improvement Fund, the \n                Secretary shall strengthen the Department's monitoring \n                of ESEA requirements for identifying and turning around \n                low-performing schools, as well as any new requirements \n                established for the School Improvement Fund by Public \n                Law 106-113. The Secretary shall give priority to \n                provisions that have the greatest bearing on \n                identifying and turning around low-performing schools, \n                including sections 1116 and 1117 of the ESEA, and to \n                developing an ongoing, focused, and systematic\n\n[[Page 26477]]\n\n                process for monitoring these provisions. This improved \n                compliance monitoring shall be designed to:\n\n                    (a) ensure that States and LEAs comply with ESEA \n                requirements;\n                    (b) assist States and LEAs in implementing \n                effective procedures and strategies that reflect the \n                best research available, as well as the experience of \n                successful schools, school districts, and States as \n                they address similar objectives and challenges; and\n                    (c) assist States, LEAs, and schools in making the \n                most effective use of available Federal resources.\n\n                Sec. 5. Consultation. The Secretary shall, where \n                appropriate, consult with executive agencies, State and \n                local education officials, educators, community-based \n                groups, and others in carrying out this Executive \n                order.\n\n                Sec. 6.

For the purposes of this order:\n\n                (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;\n\n                (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, \n                association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, \n                subgroup, or other organization;\n\n                (c) the term ``United States person'' means any United \n                States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity \n                organized under the laws of the United States or any \n                jurisdiction within the United States (including \n                foreign branches), or any person in the United States; \n                and\n\n                (d) the term ``Government of Sudan'' includes the \n                Government of Sudan, its agencies, instrumentalities, \n                and controlled entities, and the Central Bank of Sudan, \n                but does not include the regional government of \n                Southern Sudan.\n\n                Sec. 7. For those persons whose property and interests \n                in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this \n                order who might have a constitutional presence in the \n                United States, I find that, because of the ability to \n                transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior \n                notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant \n                to this order would render these measures ineffectual. \n                I therefore determine that for these measures to be \n                effective in addressing the national emergency declared \n                in Executive Order 13067 there need be no prior notice \n                of a determination made pursuant to section 1 of this \n                order.\n\n                Sec. 8. The Secretary of the Treasury, after \n                consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby \n                authorized to take such actions, including the \n                promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ \n                all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be \n                necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The \n                Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these \n                functions to other officers and agencies of the United \n                States Government, consistent with applicable law. All \n                executive agencies of the United States Government are \n                hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within \n                their authority to carry out the provisions of this \n                order and, where appropriate, to advise the Secretary \n                of the Treasury in a timely manner of the measures \n                taken. The Secretary of the Treasury shall ensure \n                compliance with those provisions of section 401 of the \n                NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641) applicable to the Department of \n                the Treasury in relation to this order.\n\n                Sec. 9. This order is not intended to, and does not, \n                create any right, benefit, or privilege, substantive or \n                procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any \n                party against the United States, its departments, \n                agencies, instrumentalities, or entities, its officers \n                or employees, or any other person.\n\n[[Page 61371]]\n\n                Sec. 10.

(a) Policy. A part of USA Freedom Corps, \n                ``Volunteers for Prosperity'' is a call to service to \n                support major U.S. initiatives that promote health and \n                prosperity around the world.

United \n                States volunteers will help to achieve the objectives \n                of the global prosperity agenda, including providing \n                clean water to the poor, promoting democratic \n                governance, developing economic freedom, promoting free \n                and open markets, and stemming the spread of HIV/AIDS.\n\n                    The investment of Federal resources to enable U.S. \n                volunteers to work with nongovernmental and voluntary \n                service organizations overseas is a preferred use of \n                our resources and also will help leverage private \n                sector resources. United States citizens who are \n                skilled professionals and who volunteer, when matched \n                with organizations working on specific U.S. prosperity \n                initiatives overseas, can provide invaluable support \n                for these initiatives and will supplement and \n                complement the traditions and accomplishments of the \n                Peace Corps.\n                    United States prosperity initiatives that can \n                benefit from volunteer service include, but are not \n                limited to, the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the \n                Digital Freedom Initiative, the Water for the Poor \n                Initiative, the Trade for African Development and \n                Enterprise Initiative, and the Middle East Partnership \n                Initiative.\n                    Volunteer service in support of other initiatives, \n                consistent with U.S. foreign policy, shall be \n                considered as well.\n\n                (b) Applicability.

For those persons listed in or designated \n                pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional \n                presence in the United States, I find that because of \n                the ability to transfer funds or other assets \n                instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of \n                measures to be taken pursuant to this order\n\n[[Page 25485]]\n\n                would render these measures ineffectual. I therefore \n                determine that, for these measures to be effective in \n                addressing the national emergency declared in Executive \n                Order 13067 and expanded by this order, there need be \n                no prior notice of a listing or determination made \n                pursuant to section 1 of this order.\n\n                Sec. 5. The Secretary of the Treasury, after \n                consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby \n                authorized to take such actions, including the \n                promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ \n                all powers granted to the President by IEEPA and UNPA \n                as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this \n                order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any \n                of these functions to other officers and agencies of \n                the United States Government, consistent with \n                applicable law. All agencies of the United States \n                Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate \n                measures within their authority to carry out the \n                provisions of this order and, where appropriate, to \n                advise the Secretary of the Treasury in a timely manner \n                of the measures taken. The Secretary of the Treasury \n                shall ensure compliance with those provisions of \n                section 401 of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641) applicable to \n                the Department of the Treasury in relation to this \n                order.\n\n                Sec. 6. The Secretary of the Treasury, after \n                consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby \n                authorized to submit the recurring and final reports to \n                the Congress on the national emergency expanded by this \n                order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 \n                U.S.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of the IEEPA (50 \n                U.S.C. 1703(c)).\n\n                Sec. 7. The Secretary of the Treasury, after \n                consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby \n                authorized to determine, subsequent to the issuance of \n                this order, that circumstances no longer warrant the \n                inclusion of a person in the Annex to this order and \n                that the property and interests in property of that \n                person are therefore no longer blocked pursuant to \n                section 1 of this order.\n\n                Sec. 8. This order is not intended to, and does not, \n                create any right, benefit, or privilege, substantive or \n                procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any \n                party against the United States, its departments, \n                agencies, instrumentalities, or entities, its officers \n                or employees, or any other person.\n\n                Sec. 9.

Increasing the Federal Employment \n                Opportunities for Individuals with Disabilities. (a) \n                Recent evidence demonstrates that, throughout the \n                United States, qualified persons with disabilities have \n                been refused employment despite their availability and \n                qualifications, and many qualified persons with \n                disabilities are never made aware of available \n                employment opportunities. Evidence also suggests that \n                increased efforts at outreach, and increased \n                understanding of the reasonable accommodations \n                available for persons with disabilities, will permit \n                persons with disabilities to compete for employment on \n                a more level playing field.\n\n                    (b) Based on current hiring patterns and \n                anticipated increases from expanded outreach efforts \n                and appropriate accommodations, the Federal Government, \n                over the next 5 years, will be able to hire 100,000 \n                qualified individuals with disabilities. In furtherance \n                of such efforts, Federal agencies shall:\n\n(1) Use available hiring authorities, consistent with statutes, \nregulations, and prior Executive orders and Presidential Memoranda;\n\n(2) Expand their outreach efforts, using both traditional and \nnontraditional methods; and\n\n(3) Increase their efforts to accommodate individuals with disabilities.\n\n                    (c) As a model employer, the Federal Government \n                will take the lead in educating the public about \n                employment opportunities available for individuals with \n                disabilities.\n                    (d) This order does not require agencies to create \n                new positions or to change existing qualification \n                standards for any position.\n\n                Sec. 2. Implementation. Each Federal agency shall \n                prepare a plan to increase the opportunities for \n                individuals with disabilities to be employed in the \n                agency.

Policy. Princeville, North Carolina \n                (Princeville) has a unique place in American history. \n                This small city in eastern North Carolina was the first \n                city in the United States founded by ex-slaves. In its \n                history, Princeville has been damaged by floods many \n                times. Recently, it was devastated by floods caused by \n                Hurricane Floyd. In response to the damage, appropriate \n                Federal agencies have already begun repair and recovery \n                efforts to assist Princeville. However, it is the \n                policy of this Administration to do more to help this \n                city that occupies such a significant place in our \n                history. Therefore, this order will create an \n                interagency council to develop recommendations for \n                further actions to address the future of Princeville.\n\n                Sec. 2.

Fundamental Principles and Policymaking \n                Criteria.\n\n                In formulating and implementing policies that have \n                implications for faith-based and community \n                organizations, agencies that administer social service \n                programs supported with Federal financial assistance \n                shall, to the extent permitted by law, be guided by the \n                following fundamental principles:\n\n                    (a) Federal financial assistance for social service \n                programs should be distributed in the most effective \n                and efficient manner possible;\n                    (b) The Nation's social service capacity will \n                benefit if all eligible organizations, including faith-\n                based and other community organizations, are able to \n                compete on an equal footing for Federal financial \n                assistance used to support social service programs;\n                    (c) No organization should be discriminated against \n                on the basis of religion or religious belief in the \n                administration or distribution of Federal financial \n                assistance under social service programs;\n                    (d) All organizations that receive Federal \n                financial assistance under social services programs \n                should be prohibited from discriminating against \n                beneficiaries or potential beneficiaries of the social \n                services programs on the basis of religion or religious \n                belief. Accordingly, organizations, in providing \n                services supported in whole or in part with Federal \n                financial assistance, and in their outreach activities \n                related to such services, should not be allowed to \n                discriminate against current or prospective program \n                beneficiaries on the basis of religion, a religious \n                belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a \n                refusal to actively participate in a religious \n                practice;\n                    (e) The Federal Government must implement Federal \n                programs in accordance with the Establishment Clause \n                and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to \n                the Constitution. Therefore, organizations that engage \n                in inherently religious activities, such as worship, \n                religious instruction, and proselytization, must offer \n                those services separately in time or location from any \n                programs or services supported with direct Federal \n                financial assistance, and participation in any such \n                inherently religious activities must be voluntary for \n                the beneficiaries of the social service program \n                supported with such Federal financial assistance; and\n                    (f) Consistent with the Free Exercise Clause and \n                the Free Speech Clause of the Constitution, faith-based \n                organizations should be eligible to compete for Federal \n                financial assistance used to support social service \n                programs and to participate fully in the social service \n                programs supported with Federal financial assistance \n                without impairing their independence, autonomy, \n                expression, or religious character. Accordingly, a \n                faith-based organization that applies for or \n                participates in a social service program supported with \n                Federal financial assistance may retain its \n                independence and may continue to carry out its mission, \n                including the definition, development, practice, and \n                expression of its religious beliefs, provided that it \n                does not use direct Federal financial assistance to \n                support any inherently religious activities, such as \n                worship, religious instruction, or proselytization. \n                Among other things, faith-based organizations that \n                receive Federal financial assistance may use their \n                facilities to provide social services supported with \n                Federal financial assistance, without removing or \n                altering religious art, icons, scriptures, or other \n                symbols from these facilities. In addition, a faith-\n                based organization that applies for or participates in \n                a social service program supported with Federal \n                financial assistance may retain religious terms in its \n                organization's name,\n\n[[Page 77143]]\n\n                select its board members on a religious basis, and \n                include religious references in its organization's \n                mission statements and other chartering or governing \n                documents.\n\n                Sec. 3. Agency Implementation.\n\n                    (a) Specified agency heads shall, in coordination \n                with the White House Office of Faith-Based and \n                Community Initiatives (White House OFBCI), review and \n                evaluate existing policies that have implications for \n                faith-based and community organizations in order to \n                assess the consistency of such policies with the \n                fundamental principles and policymaking criteria \n                articulated in section 2 of this order.\n                    (b) Specified agency heads shall ensure that all \n                policies that have implications for faith-based and \n                community organizations are consistent with the \n                fundamental principles and policymaking criteria \n                articulated in section 2 of this order. Therefore, \n                specified agency heads shall, to the extent permitted \n                by law:\n\n  (i) amend all such existing policies of their respective agencies to \nensure that they are consistent with the fundamental principles and \npolicymaking criteria articulated in section 2 of this order;\n\n  (ii) where appropriate, implement new policies for their respective \nagencies that are consistent with and necessary to further the fundamental \nprinciples and policymaking criteria set forth in section 2 of this order; \nand\n\n  (iii) implement new policies that are necessary to ensure that their \nrespective agencies collect data regarding the participation of faith-based \nand community organizations in social service programs that receive Federal \nfinancial assistance.\n\n                    (c) Within 90 days after the date of this order, \n                each specified agency head shall report to the \n                President, through the Director of the White House \n                OFBCI, the actions it proposes to undertake to \n                accomplish the activities set forth in sections 3(a) \n                and (b) of this order.\n\n                Sec. 4.

App.), it is hereby ordered as \n                follows:\n\n                Section 1. Policy. A quality education is essential to \n                the success of every child in the 21st century and to \n                the continued strength and prosperity of our Nation. \n                Our Nation has embraced the goal of promoting high \n                educational standards for all children and increasing \n                accountability in education. Although we know it is \n                crucial that all children have access to the \n                educational resources and opportunity necessary to \n                achieve high standards, long-standing gaps in access to \n                educational resources exist, including disparities \n                based on race and ethnicity. These gaps limit the \n                ability of individuals, as well as our Nation, to reach \n                their full potential. Therefore, it is the policy of \n                this Administration that our Nation undertake \n                appropriate steps to understand fully the current \n                status of resource equity in education and to identify \n                and implement strategies at the local, State, and \n                national levels that will ensure that all students have \n                a full and equal opportunity to succeed.\n\n                Sec. 2. Establishment. To carry out this policy, there \n                is established the ``President's Commission on \n                Educational Resource Equity'' (Commission). The \n                Commission shall be composed of not more than 13 \n                members appointed by the President from the public and \n                private sectors.

The President shall designate from \n                among the Commission members such official or officials \n                to be chairperson or chairpersons, as he shall deem \n                appropriate.\n\n                Sec. 3. Duties and Commission Report.

General Determinations. (a) The United \n                States is engaged in an armed conflict with al Qaeda, \n                the Taliban, and associated forces. Members of al Qaeda \n                were responsible for the attacks on the United States \n                of September 11, 2001, and for many other terrorist \n                attacks, including against the United States, its \n                personnel, and its allies throughout the world. These \n                forces continue to fight the United States and its \n                allies in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere, and they \n                continue to plan additional acts of terror throughout \n                the world. On February 7, 2002, I determined for the \n                United States that members of al Qaeda, the Taliban, \n                and associated forces are unlawful enemy combatants who \n                are not entitled to the protections that the Third \n                Geneva Convention provides to prisoners of war. I \n                hereby reaffirm that determination.\n\n                (b) The Military Commissions Act defines certain \n                prohibitions of Common Article 3 for United States law, \n                and it reaffirms and reinforces the authority of the \n                President to interpret the meaning and application of \n                the Geneva Conventions.\n\n                Sec. 2.

As used in this order:\n\n                (a) ``Common Article 3'' means Article 3 of the Geneva \n                Conventions.\n\n                (b) ``Geneva Conventions'' means:\n\n(i) the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and \nSick in Armed Forces in the Field, done at Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST \n3114);\n\n(ii) the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick \nand Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, done at Geneva August 12, \n1949 (6 UST 3217);\n\n(iii) the Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, done at \nGeneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3316); and\n\n(iv) the Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time \nof War, done at Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3516).\n\n                (c) ``Cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or \n                punishment'' means the cruel, unusual, and inhumane \n                treatment or punishment prohibited by the Fifth, \n                Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution \n                of the United States.\n\n                Sec. 3. Compliance of a Central Intelligence Agency \n                Detention and Interrogation Program with Common Article \n                3. (a) Pursuant to the authority of the President under \n                the Constitution and the laws of the United States, \n                including the Military Commissions Act of 2006, this \n                order interprets the meaning and application of the \n                text of Common Article 3 with respect to certain \n                detentions and interrogations, and shall be treated as \n                authoritative for all\n\n[[Page 40708]]\n\n                purposes as a matter of United States law, including \n                satisfaction of the international obligations of the \n                United States. I hereby determine that Common Article 3 \n                shall apply to a program of detention and interrogation \n                operated by the Central Intelligence Agency as set \n                forth in this section.

BUSH, President of the United States of \n                America, note that the actions and policies of former \n                Liberian President Charles Taylor and other persons, in \n                particular their unlawful depletion of Liberian \n                resources and their removal from Liberia and secreting \n                of Liberian funds and property, have undermined \n                Liberia's transition to democracy and the orderly \n                development of its political, administrative, and \n                economic institutions and resources. I further note \n                that the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed on August \n                18, 2003, and the related ceasefire have not yet been \n                universally implemented throughout Liberia, and that \n                the illicit trade in round logs and timber products is \n                linked to the proliferation of and trafficking in \n                illegal arms, which perpetuate the Liberian conflict \n                and fuel and exacerbate other conflicts throughout West \n                Africa. I find that the actions, policies, and \n                circumstances described above constitute an unusual and \n                extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the \n                United States and hereby declare a national emergency \n                to deal with that threat.

(a) Any transaction by a United States person \n                or within the United States that evades or avoids, has \n                the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to \n                violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order \n                is prohibited.\n\n                (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the \n                prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.\n\n                Sec. 4. For purposes of this order: (a) the term \n                ``person'' means an individual or entity;\n\n                (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, \n                association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, \n                subgroup, or other organization;\n\n                (c) the term ``United States person'' means any United \n                States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity \n                organized under the laws of the United States or any \n                jurisdiction within the United States (including \n                foreign branches), or any person in the United States; \n                and\n\n                (d) the term ``round log or timber product'' means any \n                product classifiable in Chapter 44 of the Harmonized \n                Tariff Schedule of the United States.\n\n                Sec. 5. For those persons whose property and interests \n                in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this \n                order who might have a constitutional presence in the \n                United States, I find that because of the ability to \n                transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior \n                notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant \n                to this order would render these measures ineffectual. \n                I therefore determine that for these measures to be \n                effective in addressing the national emergency declared \n                in this order, there need be no prior notice of a \n                listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of \n                this order.\n\n                Sec. 6. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to \n                take such actions, including the promulgation of rules \n                and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to \n                the President by IEEPA and UNPA as may be necessary to \n                carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of \n                the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to \n                other officers and agencies of the United States \n                Government, consistent with applicable law. All \n                agencies of the United States Government are hereby \n                directed to take all appropriate measures within their \n                authority to carry out the provisions of this order \n                and, where appropriate, to advise the Secretary of the \n                Treasury in a timely manner of the measures taken.\n\n[[Page 44887]]\n\n                Sec. 7. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to \n                submit the recurring and final reports to the Congress \n                on the national emergency declared in this order, \n                consistent with section 401(c) of NEA, 50 U.S.C. \n                1641(c), and section 204(c) of IEEPA, 50 U.S.C. \n                1703(c).\n\n                Sec. 8. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to \n                determine, subsequent to the issuance of this order, \n                that circumstances no longer warrant the inclusion of a \n                person in the Annex to this order and that the property \n                and interests in property of that person are therefore \n                no longer blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order.\n\n                Sec. 9. This order is not intended to, and does not, \n                create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, \n                enforceable at law or in equity by any party against \n                the United States, its departments, agencies, \n                instrumentalities, or entities, its officers or \n                employees, or any other person.\n\n                Sec. 10. This order is effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern \n                daylight time on July 23, 2004.\n\n                Sec. 11.

Pursuant to section 207(a) of IEEPA (50 \n                U.S.C. 1706(a)), and subject to such regulations, \n                orders, directives, or licenses as may be issued \n                pursuant to this order, I hereby determine that the \n                continuation of prohibitions with regard to \n                transactions involving property blocked pursuant to \n                Executive Orders 12722 or 12724 that continues to be \n                blocked as of the effective date of this order is \n                necessary on account of claims involving Iraq.\n\n                Sec. 2. The Annex to Executive Order 13315 is replaced \n                and superseded in its entirety by the Annex to this \n                order.\n\n                Sec. 3. I hereby amend Executive Order 13290 by \n                removing ``the national emergency declared in Executive \n                Order 12722 of August 2, 1990'' and replacing it with \n                ``the national emergency declared in Executive Order \n                13303 of March 20, 2003, and expanded in Executive \n                Order 13315 of August 28, 2003''.\n\n[[Page 46056]]\n\n                Sec. 4. Unless licensed or otherwise authorized \n                pursuant to this order or otherwise consistent with \n                U.S. law, the trade in or transfer of ownership or \n                possession of Iraqi cultural property or other items of \n                archeological, historical, cultural, rare scientific, \n                and religious importance that were illegally removed, \n                or for which a reasonable suspicion exists that they \n                were illegally removed, from the Iraq National Museum, \n                the National Library, and other locations in Iraq since \n                August 6, 1990, is prohibited.\n\n                Sec. 5. I hereby determine that the making of donations \n                of the type specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 \n                U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by or to persons determined to be \n                subject to the sanctions imposed by Executive Order \n                13315 or by this order would seriously impair my \n                ability to deal with the national emergency declared in \n                Executive Order 13303, and expanded by Executive Order \n                13315, or would endanger the Armed Forces of the United \n                States that are engaged in hostilities, and I hereby \n                prohibit such donations as provided in section 1 of \n                Executive Order 13315 as amended by this order.\n\n                Sec. 6. For those persons listed in the Annex to this \n                order or determined to be subject to Executive Order \n                13315 or this order who might have a constitutional \n                presence in the United States, I find that because of \n                the ability to transfer funds or other assets \n                instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of \n                measures to be taken pursuant to this order would \n                render these measures ineffectual. I therefore \n                determine that for these measures to be effective in \n                addressing the national emergency declared in Executive \n                Order 13303, and expanded by Executive Order 13315, \n                there need be no prior notice of a listing or \n                determination made pursuant to Executive Order 13315 or \n                this order.\n\n                Sec. 7. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to \n                take such actions, including the promulgation of rules \n                and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to \n                the President by IEEPA and UNPA as may be necessary to \n                carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of \n                the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to \n                other officers and agencies of the United States \n                Government consistent with applicable law. All agencies \n                of the United States Government are hereby directed to \n                take all appropriate measures within their authority to \n                carry out the provisions of this order.\n\n                Sec. 8. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State, is authorized to determine \n                subsequent to the issuance of the order, that \n                circumstances no longer warrant the inclusion of a \n                person in the Annex to this order and that such person \n                is therefore no longer covered within the scope of the \n                order.\n\n                Sec. 9.

(a) Any transaction by a United States person \n                or within the United States that evades or avoids, has \n                the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to \n                violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order \n                is prohibited.\n\n                (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the \n                prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.\n\n                Sec. 3. For purposes of this order:\n\n                (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;\n\n                (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, \n                association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, \n                subgroup, or other organization;\n\n                (c) the term ``United States person'' means any United \n                States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity \n                organized under the laws of the United States or any \n                jurisdiction within the United States (including \n                foreign branches), or any person in the United States.\n\n                Sec. 4. For those persons listed in or designated \n                pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional \n                presence in the United States, I find that because of \n                the ability to transfer funds or other assets \n                instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of \n                measures to be taken pursuant to this order would \n                render these measures ineffectual. I therefore \n                determine that for these measures to be effective in \n                addressing the national emergency declared in this \n                order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or \n                determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.\n\n                Sec. 5. The Secretary of the Treasury, after \n                consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby \n                authorized to take such actions, including the \n                promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ \n                all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be \n                necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The \n                Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these \n                functions to other officers and agencies of the United \n                States Government, consistent with applicable law. All \n                executive agencies of the United States Government are \n                hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within \n                their authority to carry out the provisions of this \n                order and, where appropriate, to advise the Secretary \n                of the Treasury in a timely manner of the measures \n                taken. The Secretary of the Treasury shall ensure \n                compliance with those provisions of section 401 of the \n                NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641) applicable to the Department of \n                the Treasury in relation to this order.\n\n                Sec. 6. The Secretary of the Treasury, after \n                consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby \n                authorized to submit the recurring and final reports to \n                the Congress on the national emergency declared in this \n                order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 \n                U.S.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. \n                1703(c)).\n\n                Sec. 7. The Secretary of the Treasury, after \n                consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby \n                authorized to determine, subsequent to the issuance of \n                this order, that circumstances no longer warrant the \n                inclusion of a person in the Annex to this order and \n                that the property and interests in property of that \n                person are therefore no longer blocked pursuant to \n                section 1 of this order.\n\n                Sec. 8.

For purposes of this order:\n\n                (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;\n\n                (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, \n                association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, \n                subgroup, or other organization; and\n\n                (c) the term ``United States person'' means any United \n                States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity \n                organized under the laws of the United States or any \n                jurisdiction within the United States (including \n                foreign branches), or any person in the United States.\n\n                Sec. 4. I hereby determine that the making of donations \n                of the type specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 \n                U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of, any \n                person whose property and interests in property are \n                blocked pursuant to this order would seriously impair \n                my ability to deal with the national emergency declared \n                in Executive Order 13303 and expanded in Executive \n                Order 13315, and I hereby prohibit such donations as \n                provided by section 1 of this order.\n\n                Sec. 5. For those persons whose property and interests \n                in property are blocked pursuant to this order who \n                might have a constitutional presence in the United \n                States, I find that, because of the ability to transfer \n                funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to \n                such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this \n                order would render these measures ineffectual. I \n                therefore determine that for these measures to be \n                effective in addressing the national emergency declared \n                in Executive Order 13303 and expanded in Executive \n                Order 13315, there need be no prior notice of a listing \n                or determination made pursuant to section 1(a) of this \n                order.\n\n                Sec. 6. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of \n                Defense, is hereby authorized to take such actions, \n                including the promulgation of rules and regulations, \n                and to employ all powers granted to the President by \n                IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of \n                this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may \n                redelegate any of these functions to other officers and \n                agencies of the United States Government, consistent \n                with applicable law. All agencies of the United States \n                Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate \n                measures within their authority to carry out the \n                provisions of this order and, where appropriate, to \n                advise the Secretary of the Treasury in a timely manner \n                of the measures taken.\n\n                Sec. 7.

Task Force on Disaster Assistance \n                Coordination. (a) Plan to Improve Delivery of Federal \n                Disaster Assistance. To further the policy in section 1 \n                of this order, there is established the interagency \n                ``Task Force on Disaster Assistance Coordination'' \n                (Task Force). The Task Force shall develop a plan to \n                streamline and otherwise improve the delivery of \n                Federal disaster assistance (Plan). The Plan shall:\n\n                    (i) include an inventory of Federal disaster \n                assistance programs and assess the effectiveness of \n                their respective delivery mechanisms;\n                    (ii) recommend specific actions to improve the \n                delivery of Federal disaster assistance, which shall \n                include actions to provide a centralized application \n                process for Federal disaster assistance, provide a \n                centralized and continuously updated clearinghouse from \n                which disaster victims may obtain information regarding \n                Federal disaster assistance and State and local \n                government and private sector sources of disaster \n                assistance, reduce unnecessarily duplicative \n                application forms and processes for Federal disaster \n                assistance, and strengthen controls designed to prevent \n                improper payments and other forms of fraud, waste, and \n                abuse; and\n                    (iii) include an implementation schedule for the \n                Plan's recommendations that provides for the phased \n                implementation of the Plan by December 31, 2008, \n                including quarterly milestones and metrics to be used \n                to measure and evaluate implementation.\n\n                (b) Membership of the Task Force. (i) The Task Force \n                shall consist exclusively of the following members, or \n                their designees who shall be at the Assistant Secretary \n                level (or its equivalent) or higher:\n\n(A) the Secretary of Homeland Security, who shall serve as Chair;\n\n(B) the Secretary of the Treasury;\n\n(C) the Secretary of Defense;\n\n(D) the Attorney General;\n\n(E) the Secretary of Agriculture;\n\n(F) the Secretary of Commerce;\n\n(G) the Secretary of Labor;\n\n(H) the Secretary of Health and Human Services;\n\n(I) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development;\n\n[[Page 52730]]\n\n(J) the Secretary of Education;\n\n(K) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs;\n\n(L) the Director of the Office of Personnel Management;\n\n(M) the Commissioner of Social Security;\n\n(N) the Administrator of the Small Business Administration;\n\n(O) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget; and\n\n(P) such other officers of the United States as the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity may designate from time to time.\n\n                (ii) The Secretary of Homeland Security, or the \n                Secretary's designee, shall convene and preside at \n                meetings of the Task Force, determine its agenda, \n                direct its work, and, as appropriate to address \n                specific subject matters, establish and direct \n                subgroups of the Task Force.

Upon approval of the Plan by the \n                President, the Secretary of Homeland Security, assisted \n                by the Task Force, shall coordinate the implementation \n                of the Plan. Until the completion of such \n                implementation, the Secretary of Homeland Security \n                shall submit a quarterly progress report to the \n                Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and \n                Counterterrorism and the Director of the Office of \n                Management and Budget.\n\n                Sec. 3. Assistance and Support. To the extent permitted \n                by law, the heads of all executive departments and \n                agencies shall provide such assistance and information \n                as the Secretary of Homeland Security may request in \n                carrying out the Secretary's responsibilities under \n                this order. Consistent with applicable law and subject \n                to the availability of appropriations, the Department \n                of Homeland Security shall provide necessary funding \n                and administrative support for the Task Force.\n\n                Sec. 4. Administration. This order shall: (a) be \n                implemented in a manner consistent with applicable \n                laws, including Federal laws protecting the information \n                privacy rights and other legal rights of Americans, and \n                subject to the availability of appropriations;\n\n                (b) be implemented in a manner consistent with the \n                statutory authority of the principal officers of \n                executive departments and agencies as heads of their \n                respective departments or agencies; and\n\n                (c) not be construed to impair or otherwise affect the \n                functions of the Director of the Office of Management \n                and Budget relating to budget, administrative, \n                regulatory, and legislative responsibilities.\n\n                Sec. 5.

Policy.\n\n                It shall be the policy of the Government of the United \n                States that law enforcement may not use protected \n                health information concerning an individual that is \n                discovered during the course of health oversight \n                activities for unrelated civil, administrative, or \n                criminal investigations of a non-health oversight \n                matter, except when the balance of relevant factors \n                weighs clearly in favor of its use. That is, protected \n                health information may not be so used unless the public \n                interest and the need for disclosure clearly outweigh \n                the potential for injury to the patient, to the \n                physician-patient relationship, and to the treatment \n                services. Protecting the privacy of patients' protected \n                health information promotes trust in the health care \n                system. It improves the quality of health care by \n                fostering an environment in which patients can feel \n                more comfortable in providing health care professionals \n                with accurate and detailed information about their \n                personal health. In order to provide greater \n                protections to patients' privacy, the Department of \n                Health and Human Services is issuing final regulations \n                concerning the confidentiality of individually \n                identifiable health information under the Health \n                Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 \n                (HIPAA). HIPAA applies only to ``covered entities,'' \n                such as health care plans, providers, and \n                clearinghouses. HIPAA regulations therefore do not \n                apply to other organizations and individuals that gain \n                access to protected health information, including \n                Federal officials who gain access to health records \n                during health oversight activities.\n\n                Under the new HIPAA regulations, health oversight \n                investigators will appropriately have ready access to \n                medical records for oversight purposes. Health \n                oversight investigators generally do not seek access to \n                the medical records of a particular patient, but \n                instead review large numbers of records to determine \n                whether a health care provider or organization is \n                violating the law, such as through fraud against the \n                Medicare system. Access to many health records is often \n                necessary in order to gain enough evidence to detect \n                and bring enforcement actions against fraud in the \n                health care system. Stricter rules apply under the \n                HIPAA regulations, however, when law enforcement \n                officials seek protected health information in order to \n                investigate criminal activity outside of the health \n                oversight realm.\n\n                In the course of their efforts to protect the health \n                care system, health oversight investigators may also \n                uncover evidence of wrongdoing unrelated to the health \n                care system, such as evidence of criminal conduct by an \n                individual who has sought health care. For records \n                containing that evidence, the issue thus arises whether \n                the information should be available for law enforcement \n                purposes under the less restrictive oversight rules or \n                the more restrictive rules that apply to non-oversight \n                criminal investigations.\n\n                A similar issue has arisen in other circumstances. \n                Under 18 U.S.C. 3486, an individual's health records \n                obtained for health oversight purposes pursuant to an \n                administrative subpoena may not be used against that \n                individual patient in an unrelated investigation by law \n                enforcement unless a judicial officer finds good cause. \n                Under that statute, a judicial officer determines\n\n[[Page 81322]]\n\n                whether there is good cause by weighing the public \n                interest and the need for disclosure against the \n                potential for injury to the patient, to the physician-\n                patient relationship, and to the treatment services. It \n                is appropriate to extend limitations on the use of \n                health information to all situations in which the \n                government obtains medical records for a health \n                oversight purpose. In recognition of the increasing \n                importance of protecting health information as shown in \n                the medical privacy rule, a higher standard than exists \n                in 18 U.S.C. 3486 is necessary. It is, therefore, the \n                policy of the Government of the United States that law \n                enforcement may not use protected health information \n                concerning an individual, discovered during the course \n                of health oversight activities for unrelated civil, \n                administrative, or criminal investigations, against \n                that indi vidual except when the balance of relevant \n                factors weighs clearly in favor of its use. That is, \n                protected health information may not be so used unless \n                the public interest and the need for disclosure clearly \n                outweigh the potential for injury to the patient, to \n                the physician-patient relationship, and to the \n                treatment services.\n\n                Sec. 2.

Policy. About 80 percent of Americans live \n                in urban areas, and the economic health and social \n                vitality of our urban communities are critically \n                important to the prosperity and quality of life for \n                Americans. Vibrant cities spawn innovation, economic \n                growth, and cultural enrichment through the businesses, \n                universities, and civic, cultural, religious, and \n                nonprofit institutions they attract. Forward-looking \n                policies that encourage wise investment and development \n                in our urban areas will create employment and housing \n                opportunities and make our country more competitive, \n                prosperous, and strong. In the past, insufficient \n                attention has been paid to the problems faced by urban \n                areas and to coordinating the many Federal programs \n                that affect our cities. A more comprehensive approach \n                is needed, both to develop an effective strategy for \n                urban America and to coordinate the actions of the many \n                executive departments and agencies whose actions impact \n                urban life.\n\n                Sec. 2. Establishment. There is established within the \n                Executive Office of the President the White House \n                Office of Urban Affairs (the ``Office'').\n\n                Sec. 3. Functions. The principal functions of the \n                Office are, to the extent permitted by law:\n\n                    (a) to provide leadership for and coordinate the \n                development of the policy agenda for urban America \n                across executive departments and agencies;\n                    (b) to coordinate all aspects of urban policy;\n                    (c) to work with executive departments and agencies \n                to ensure that appropriate consideration is given by \n                such departments and agencies to the potential impact \n                of their actions on urban areas;\n                    (d) to work with executive departments and \n                agencies, including the Office of Management and \n                Budget, to ensure that Federal Government dollars \n                targeted to urban areas are effectively spent on the \n                highest-impact programs; and\n                    (e) to engage in outreach and work closely with \n                State and local officials, with nonprofit \n                organizations, and with the private sector, both in \n                seeking input regarding the development of a \n                comprehensive urban policy and in ensuring that the \n                implementation of Federal programs advances the \n                objectives of that policy.\n\n                Sec. 4. Coordination. In performing its functions, the \n                Office shall work closely with all relevant executive \n                departments and agencies, and offices and councils \n                within the Executive Office of the President, including \n                but not limited to:\n\n                    (a) the Department of the Treasury;\n                    (b) the Department of Justice;\n                    (c) the Department of Commerce;\n                    (d) the Department of Labor;\n                    (e) the Department of Health and Human Services;\n\n[[Page 8140]]\n\n                    (f) the Department of Housing and Urban \n                Development;\n                    (g) the Department of Transportation;\n                    (h) the Department of Energy;\n                    (i) the Department of Education; and\n                    (j) the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n                Sec. 5.

The Director shall report jointly \n                to the Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental \n                Affairs and Public Liaison and to the Assistant to the \n                President for Domestic Policy.

The Federal Government has nationally \n                significant assets in the Chesapeake Bay and its \n                watershed in the form of public lands, facilities, \n                military installations, parks, forests, wildlife \n                refuges, monuments, and museums.\n\n                Despite significant efforts by Federal, State, and \n                local governments and other interested parties, water \n                pollution in the Chesapeake Bay prevents the attainment \n                of existing State water quality standards and the \n                ``fishable and swimmable'' goals of the Clean Water \n                Act. At the current level and scope of pollution \n                control within the Chesapeake Bay's watershed, \n                restoration of the Chesapeake Bay is not expected for \n                many years. The pollutants that are largely responsible \n                for pollution of the Chesapeake Bay are nutrients, in \n                the form of nitrogen and phosphorus, and sediment. \n                These pollutants come from many sources, including \n                sewage treatment plants, city streets, development \n                sites, agricultural operations, and deposition from the \n                air onto the waters of the Chesapeake Bay and the lands \n                of the watershed.\n\n                Restoration of the health of the Chesapeake Bay will \n                require a renewed commitment to controlling pollution \n                from all sources as well as protecting and restoring \n                habitat and living resources, conserving lands, and \n                improving management of natural resources, all of which \n                contribute to improved water quality and ecosystem \n                health. The Federal Government should lead this effort. \n                Executive departments and agencies (agencies), working \n                in collaboration, can use their expertise and resources \n                to contribute significantly to improving the health of \n                the Chesapeake Bay. Progress in restoring the \n                Chesapeake Bay also will depend on the support of State \n                and local governments, the enterprise of the private \n                sector, and the stewardship provided to the Chesapeake \n                Bay by all the people who make this region their home.\n\n                 PART 2--SHARED FEDERAL LEADERSHIP, PLANNING, AND \n                ACCOUNTABILITY \n\n                Sec. 201.

In order to \n                begin a new era of shared Federal leadership with \n                respect to the protection and restoration of the \n                Chesapeake Bay, a Federal Leadership Committee \n                (Committee) for the Chesapeake Bay is established to \n                oversee the development and coordination of programs \n                and activities, including data management and \n                reporting, of agencies participating in protection and \n                restoration of the Chesapeake Bay. The Committee shall \n                manage the development of strategies and program plans \n                for the watershed and ecosystem of the Chesapeake Bay \n                and oversee their implementation. The Committee shall \n                be chaired by the Administrator of the Environmental \n                Protection Agency (EPA), or the Administrator's \n                designee, and include senior representatives of the \n                Departments of Agriculture\n\n[[Page 23100]]\n\n                (USDA), Commerce (DOC), Defense (DOD), Homeland \n                Security (DHS), the Interior (DOI), Transportation \n                (DOT), and such other agencies as determined by the \n                Committee.

The DOI and the DOC shall share the \n                lead on subsections (d), (f), and (g), and the DOI \n                shall be lead on subsection (e). The lead agencies \n                shall provide final reports to the Committee within 180 \n                days of the date of this order.\n\n                Sec. 203. Strategy for Protecting and Restoring the \n                Chesapeake Bay. The Committee shall prepare and publish \n                a strategy for coordinated implementation of existing \n                programs and projects to guide efforts to protect and \n                restore the Chesapeake Bay. The strategy shall, to the \n                extent permitted by law:\n\n                    (a) define environmental goals for the Chesapeake \n                Bay and describe milestones for making progress toward \n                attainment of these goals;\n                    (b) identify key measureable indicators of \n                environmental condition and changes that are critical \n                to effective Federal leadership;\n                    (c) describe the specific programs and strategies \n                to be implemented, including the programs and \n                strategies described in draft reports developed under \n                section 202 of this order;\n                    (d) identify the mechanisms that will assure that \n                governmental and other activities, including data \n                collection and distribution, are coordinated and \n                effective, relying on existing mechanisms where \n                appropriate; and\n                    (e) describe a process for the implementation of \n                adaptive management principles, including a periodic \n                evaluation of protection and restoration activities.\n\n[[Page 23101]]\n\n                The Committee shall review the draft reports submitted \n                by lead agencies under section 202 of this order and, \n                in consultation with relevant State agencies, suggest \n                appropriate revisions to the agency that provided the \n                draft report. It shall then integrate these reports \n                into a coordinated strategy for restoration and \n                protection of the Chesapeake Bay consistent with the \n                requirements of this order. Together with the final \n                reports prepared by the lead agencies, the draft \n                strategy shall be published for public review and \n                comment within 180 days of the date of this order and a \n                final strategy shall be published within 1 year.

Collaboration with State Partners. In \n                preparing the reports under section 202 and the \n                strategy under section 203, the lead agencies and the \n                Committee shall consult extensively with the States of \n                Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New \n                York, and Delaware and the District of Columbia. The \n                goal of this consultation is to ensure that Federal \n                actions to protect and restore the Chesapeake Bay are \n                closely coordinated with actions by State and local \n                agencies in the watershed and that the resources, \n                authorities, and expertise of Federal, State, and local \n                agencies are used as efficiently as possible for the \n                benefit of the Chesapeake Bay's water quality and \n                ecosystem and habitat health and viability.\n\n                Sec. 205. Annual Action Plan and Progress Report. \n                Beginning in 2010, the Committee shall publish an \n                annual Chesapeake Bay Action Plan (Action Plan) \n                describing how Federal funding proposed in the \n                President's Budget will be used to protect and restore \n                the Chesapeake Bay during the upcoming fiscal year. \n                This plan will be accompanied by an Annual Progress \n                Report reviewing indicators of environmental conditions \n                in the Chesapeake Bay, assessing implementation of the \n                Action Plan during the preceding fiscal year, and \n                recommending steps to improve progress in restoring and \n                protecting the Chesapeake Bay. The Committee shall \n                consult with stakeholders (including relevant State \n                agencies) and members of the public in developing the \n                Action Plan and Annual Progress Report.\n\n                Sec. 206. Strengthen Accountability. The Committee, in \n                collaboration with State agencies, shall ensure that an \n                independent evaluator periodically reports to the \n                Committee on progress toward meeting the goals of this \n                order. The Committee shall ensure that all program \n                evaluation reports, including data on practice or \n                system implementation and maintenance funded through \n                agency programs, as appropriate, are made available to \n                the public by posting on a website maintained by the \n                Chair of the Committee.\n\n                PART 3--RESTORE CHESAPEAKE BAY WATER QUALITY\n\n                Sec. 301.

For the purposes of this order:\n\n                (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;\n\n                (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, \n                association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, \n                subgroup, or other organization; and\n\n                (c) the term ``United States person'' means any United \n                States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity \n                organized under the laws of the United States or any \n                jurisdiction within the United States (including \n                foreign branches), or any person in the United States.\n\n                Sec. 4. For those persons listed in or designated \n                pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional \n                presence in the United States, I find that, because of \n                the ability to transfer funds or other assets \n                instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of \n                measures to be taken pursuant to this order would \n                render these measures ineffectual. I therefore \n                determine that for these measures to be effective in \n                addressing the national emergency declared in this \n                order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or \n                determination made pursuant to subsection 1(a) of this \n                order.\n\n                Sec. 5.

For the purposes of this order:\n\n                    (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or \n                entity;\n                    (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, \n                association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, \n                subgroup, or other organization; and\n                    (c) the term ``United States person'' means any \n                United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity \n                organized under the laws of the United States or any \n                jurisdiction within the United States (including \n                foreign branches), or any person in the United States.\n\n                Sec. 4. For those persons designated pursuant to this \n                order who might have a constitutional presence in the \n                United States, I find that, because of the ability to \n                transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior \n                notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant \n                to this order would render these measures ineffectual. \n                I therefore determine that for these measures to be \n                effective in addressing the national emergency declared \n                in Executive Order 13338, there need be no prior notice \n                of a determination made pursuant to section 1(a) of \n                this order.\n\n                Sec. 5. The Secretary of the Treasury, after \n                consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby \n                authorized to take such actions, including the \n                promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ \n                all powers granted to the President by IEEPA and UNPA, \n                as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this \n                order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any \n                of these functions to other officers and agencies of \n                the United States Government, consistent with \n                applicable law. All agencies of the United States \n                Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate \n                measures within their authority to carry out the \n                provisions of this order and, where appropriate, to \n                advise the Secretary of the Treasury in a timely manner \n                of the measures taken.\n\n                Sec. 6. This order is not intended to, and does not, \n                create any right, benefit or privilege, substantive or \n                procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any \n                party against the United States, its departments, \n                agencies, instrumentalities, or entities, its officers \n                or employees, or any other person.\n\n[[Page 25061]]\n\n                Sec. 7.

Policy. With nearly 3 million civilian \n                employees, the Federal Government can and should \n                demonstrate leadership in reducing the dangers of text \n                messaging while driving. Recent deadly crashes \n                involving drivers distracted by text messaging while \n                behind the wheel highlight a growing danger on our \n                roads. Text messaging causes drivers to take their eyes \n                off the road and at least one hand off the steering \n                wheel, endangering both themselves and others. Every \n                day, Federal employees drive Government-owned, \n                Government-leased, or Government-rented vehicles \n                (collectively, GOV) or privately-owned vehicles (POV) \n                on official Government business, and some Federal \n                employees use Government-supplied electronic devices to \n                text or e-mail while driving. A Federal Government-wide \n                prohibition on the use of text messaging while driving \n                on official business or while using Government-supplied \n                equipment will help save lives, reduce injuries, and \n                set an example for State and local governments, private \n                employers, and individual drivers. Extending this \n                policy to cover Federal contractors is designed to \n                promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. \n                Federal contractors and contractor employees who \n                refrain from the unsafe practice of text messaging \n                while driving in connection with Government business \n                are less likely to experience disruptions to their \n                operations that would adversely impact Federal \n                procurement.\n\n                Sec. 2. Text Messaging While Driving by Federal \n                Employees. Federal employees shall not engage in text \n                messaging (a) when driving GOV, or when driving POV \n                while on official Government business, or (b) when \n                using electronic equipment supplied by the Government \n                while driving.\n\n                Sec. 3. Scope of Order. (a) All agencies of the \n                executive branch are directed to take appropriate \n                action within the scope of their existing programs to \n                further the policies of this order and to implement \n                section 2 of this order. This includes, but is not \n                limited to, considering new rules and programs, and \n                reevaluating existing programs to prohibit text \n                messaging while driving, and conducting education, \n                awareness, and other outreach for Federal employees \n                about the safety risks associated with texting while \n                driving. These initiatives should encourage voluntary \n                compliance with the agency's text messaging policy \n                while off duty.\n\n(b) Within 90 days of the date of this order, each agency is directed, \nconsistent with all applicable laws and regulations: (i) to take \nappropriate measures to implement this order, (ii) to adopt measures to \nensure compliance with section 2 of this order, including through \nappropriate disciplinary actions, and (iii) to notify the Secretary of \nTransportation of the measures it undertakes hereunder.\n\n(c) Agency heads may exempt from the requirements of this order, in whole \nor in part, certain employees, devices, or vehicles in their respective\n\n[[Page 51226]]\n\nagencies that are engaged in or used for protective, law enforcement, or \nnational security responsibilities or on the basis of other emergency \nconditions.\n\n                Sec. 4. Text Messaging While Driving by Government \n                Contractors, Subcontractors, and Recipients and \n                Subrecipients. Each Federal agency, in procurement \n                contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements, and \n                other grants to the extent authorized by applicable \n                statutory authority, entered into after the date of \n                this order, shall encourage contractors, \n                subcontractors, and recipients and subrecipients to \n                adopt and enforce policies that ban text messaging \n                while driving company-owned or -rented vehicles or GOV, \n                or while driving POV when on official Government \n                business or when performing any work for or on behalf \n                of the Government. Agencies should also encourage \n                Federal contractors, subcontractors, and grant \n                recipients and subrecipients as described in this \n                section to conduct initiatives of the type described in \n                section 3(a) of this order.\n\n                Sec. 5. Coordination. The Secretary of Transportation, \n                in consultation with the Administrator of General \n                Services and the Director of the Office of Personnel \n                Management, shall provide leadership and guidance to \n                the heads of executive branch agencies to assist them \n                with any action pursuant to this order.\n\n                Sec. 6. Definitions.\n\n(a) The term ``agency'' as used in this order means an executive agency, as \ndefined in 5 U.S.C. 105, except for the Government Accountability Office.\n\n(b) ``Texting'' or ``Text Messaging'' means reading from or entering data \ninto any handheld or other electronic device, including for the purpose of \nSMS texting, e-mailing, instant messaging, obtaining navigational \ninformation, or engaging in any other form of electronic data retrieval or \nelectronic data communication.\n\n(c) ``Driving'' means operating a motor vehicle on an active roadway with \nthe motor running, including while temporarily stationary because of \ntraffic, a traffic light or stop sign, or otherwise. It does not include \noperating a motor vehicle with or without the motor running when one has \npulled over to the side of, or off, an active roadway and has halted in a \nlocation where one can safely remain stationary.\n\n                Sec. 7. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order \n                shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect or \n                alter:\n\n(i) Authority granted by law or Executive Order to an agency, or the head \nthereof;\n\n(ii) Powers and duties of the heads of the various departments and agencies \npursuant to the Highway Safety Act of 1966, as amended, 23 U.S.C. 402 and \n403, section 19 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as \namended, 29 U.S.C. 668, sections 7901 and 7902 of title 5, United States \nCode, or the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as \namended, 40 U.S.C. 101 et seq.;\n\n(iii) Rights, duties, or procedures under the National Labor Relations Act, \n29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.; or\n\n(iv) Functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget \nrelating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and \nsubject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n[[Page 51227]]\n\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or \nbenefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, by any \nparty against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, \nits officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n&lt;GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT&gt;\n\n                    (Presidential Sig.)\n\n                THE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n                    October 1, 2009.\n\n[FR Doc.

This order is issued consistent with the \n                following findings and principles:\n\n                    (a) A strong America depends on citizens who are \n                productive and who actively participate in the life of \n                their communities.\n                    (b) Transportation plays a critical role in \n                providing access to employment, medical and health \n                care, education, and other community services and \n                amenities. The importance of this role is underscored \n                by the variety of transportation programs that have \n                been created in conjunction with health and human \n                service programs, and by the significant Federal \n                investment in accessible public transportation systems \n                throughout the Nation.\n                    (c) These transportation resources, however, are \n                often difficult for citizens to understand and access, \n                and are more costly than necessary due to inconsistent \n                and unnecessary Federal and State program rules and \n                restrictions.\n                    (d) A broad range of Federal program funding allows \n                for the purchase or provision of transportation \n                services and resources for persons who are \n                transportation-disadvantaged. Yet, in too many \n                communities, these services and resources are \n                fragmented, unused, or altogether unavailable.\n                    (e) Federally assisted community transportation \n                services should be seamless, comprehensive, and \n                accessible to those who rely on them for their lives \n                and livelihoods. For persons with mobility limitations \n                related to advanced age, persons with disabilities, and \n                persons struggling for self-sufficiency, transportation \n                within and between our communities should be as \n                available and affordable as possible.\n                    (f) The development, implementation, and \n                maintenance of responsive, comprehensive, coordinated \n                community transportation systems is essential for \n                persons with disabilities, persons with low incomes, \n                and older adults who rely on such transportation to \n                fully participate in their communities.\n\n                Sec. 2. Definitions. (a) As used in this order, the \n                term ``agency'' means an executive department or agency \n                of the Federal Government.\n\n                    (b) For the purposes of this order, persons who are \n                transportation-disadvantaged are persons who qualify \n                for Federally conducted or Federally assisted \n                transportation-related programs or services due to \n                disability, income, or advanced age.\n\n                Sec. 3. Establishment of the Interagency Transportation \n                Coordinating Council on Access and Mobility. (a) There \n                is hereby established, within the Department of \n                Transportation for administrative purposes, the \n                ``Interagency Transportation Coordinating Council on \n                Access and Mobility'' (``Interagency Transportation \n                Coordinating Council'' or ``Council'').

The report shall:\n\n                    (a) Identify those Federal, State, Tribal and local \n                laws, regulations, procedures, and actions that have \n                proven to be most useful and appropriate in \n                coordinating transportation services for the targeted \n                populations;\n                    (b) Identify substantive and procedural \n                requirements of transportation-related Federal laws and \n                regulations that are duplicative or restrict the laws' \n                and regulations' most efficient operation;\n                    (c) Describe the results achieved, on an agency and \n                program basis, in: (i) simplifying access to \n                transportation services for persons with disabilities, \n                persons with low income, and older adults; (ii) \n                providing the most appropriate, cost-effective \n                transportation services within existing resources; and \n                (iii) reducing duplication to make funds available for \n                more services to more such persons;\n                    (d) Provide recommendations to simplify and \n                coordinate applicable substantive, procedural, and \n                administrative requirements; and\n                    (e) Provide any other recommendations that would, \n                in the judgment of the Council, advance the principles \n                set forth in section 1 of this order.\n\n                Sec. 6.

Policy. The education of all children, \n                regardless of background or disability, while chiefly a \n                State and local responsibility, must always be a \n                national priority. One of the most important goals of \n                my Administration is to support States and local \n                communities in creating and maintaining a system of \n                public education where no child is left behind. \n                Unfortunately, among those at greatest risk of being \n                left behind are children with disabilities. The \n                Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a \n                landmark statute that asserts the rights of all \n                children with disabilities to a free, appropriate \n                public education. My Administration strongly supports \n                the principles embodied in the IDEA and the goal of \n                providing special education and related services to \n                children with disabilities so that they can meet high \n                academic standards and participate fully in American \n                society. It is imperative that special education \n                operate as an integral part of a system that expects \n                high achievement of all children, rather than as a \n                means of avoiding accountability for children who are \n                more challenging to educate or who have fallen behind.\n\n                Sec. 2. Establishment. There is established a \n                President's Commission on Excellence in Special \n                Education (the ``Commission''). The Commission shall be \n                composed of not more than 19 members to be appointed by \n                the President from the public and private sectors, as \n                well as up to 5 ex officio members from the Departments \n                of Education and Health and Human Services. The members \n                may include current and former Federal, State, and \n                local government officials, recognized special \n                education experts, special and general education \n                finance experts, education researchers, educational \n                practitioners, parents of children or young adults with \n                disabilities, persons with disabilities, and others \n                with special experience and expertise in the education \n                of children with disabilities. The President shall \n                designate a Chairperson from among the members of the \n                Commission. The Secretary of Education shall select an \n                Executive Director for the Commission.\n\n                Sec. 3. Duties and Commission Report. (a) The \n                Commission shall collect information and study issues \n                related to Federal, State, and local special education \n                programs with the goal of recommending policies for \n                improving the educational performance of students with \n                disabilities. In furtherance of its duties, the \n                Commission shall invite experts and members of the \n                public to provide information and guidance.\n\n                    (b) Not later than April 30, 2002, the Commission \n                shall prepare and submit a report to the President \n                outlining its findings and recommendations. The report \n                shall include, but need not be limited to:\n                    (1) An examination of available research and \n                information on the effectiveness and cost of special \n                education and the appropriate role of the Federal \n                Government in special education programming and \n                funding. The examination shall include an analysis of \n                the factors that have contributed to the growth in \n                costs of special education since the enactment of the \n                Education for All Handicapped Children Act (a \n                predecessor of IDEA);\n                    (2) Recommendations regarding how Federal resources \n                can best be used to improve educational results for \n                students with disabilities;\n                    (3) A recommended special education research \n                agenda;\n\n[[Page 51288]]\n\n                    (4) An analysis of the impact of providing \n                appropriate early intervention in reading instruction \n                on the referral and identification of children for \n                special education;\n                    (5) An analysis of the effect of special education \n                funding on decisions to serve, place, or refer children \n                for special education services and recommendations for \n                alternative funding formulae that might distribute \n                funds to achieve better results and eliminate any \n                current incentives that undermine the goals of ensuring \n                that children with disabilities receive a high-quality \n                education;\n                    (6) An analysis of, and recommendations regarding, \n                how the Federal Government can help States and local \n                education agencies provide a high-quality education to \n                students with disabilities, including the recruitment \n                and retention of qualified personnel and the inclusion \n                of children with disabilities in performance and \n                accountability systems;\n                    (7) An analysis of the impact of Federal and State \n                statutory, regulatory, and administrative requirements \n                on the cost and effectiveness of special education \n                services, and how these requirements support or hinder \n                the educational achievement of students with \n                disabilities;\n                    (8) An assessment of how differences in local \n                educational agency size, location, demographics, and \n                wealth, and in State law and practice affect which \n                children are referred to special education, and the \n                cost of special education; and\n                    (9) A review of the experiences of State and local \n                governments in financing special education, and an \n                analysis of whether changes to the Federal ``supplement \n                not supplant'' and ``maintenance of effort'' \n                requirements are appropriate.\n\n                Sec. 4.

Policy. Veterans have served and sacrificed \n                in defense of our Nation. When they complete their \n                service, we must do everything in our power to assist \n                them in re-entering civilian life and finding \n                employment. Government as well as private employers \n                should play a prominent role in helping veterans who \n                may be struggling to find jobs. As one of the Nation's \n                leading employers, the Federal Government is in need of \n                highly skilled individuals to meet agency staffing \n                needs and to support mission objectives. Our veterans, \n                who have benefited from training and development during \n                their military service, possess a wide variety of \n                skills and experiences, as well as the motivation for \n                public service, that will help fulfill Federal \n                agencies' staffing needs. It is therefore the policy of \n                my Administration to enhance recruitment of and promote \n                employment opportunities for veterans within the \n                executive branch, consistent with merit system \n                principles and veterans' preferences prescribed by law. \n                The Federal Government will thereby help lead by \n                example in promoting veterans' employment.\n\n                Sec. 2. Council on Veterans Employment. There is hereby \n                established an interagency Council on Veterans \n                Employment (Council), to be co-chaired by the \n                Secretaries of Labor and Veterans Affairs. The Director \n                of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) shall serve \n                as Vice Chair of the Council.\n\n                (a) Mission and Function of the Council.

The Federal Government shall \n                only undertake roles in supporting aeronautics R&amp;D; that \n                are not more appropriately performed by the private \n                sector. The National Aeronautics Research and \n                Development Policy prepared by the National Science and \n                Technology Council should, to the extent consistent \n                with this order and its implementation, guide the \n                aeronautics R&amp;D; programs of the United States through \n                2020.\n\n                Sec. 2.

Policy. Following the recent enactment of \n                the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \n                ``Act''), it is necessary to establish an adequate \n                enforcement mechanism to ensure that Federal funds are \n                not used for abortion services (except in cases of rape \n                or incest, or when the life of the woman would be \n                endangered), consistent with a longstanding Federal \n                statutory restriction that is commonly known as the \n                Hyde Amendment. The purpose of this order is to \n                establish a comprehensive, Government-wide set of \n                policies and procedures to achieve this goal and to \n                make certain that all relevant actors--Federal \n                officials, State officials (including insurance \n                regulators) and health care providers--are aware of \n                their responsibilities, new and old.\n\n                The Act maintains current Hyde Amendment restrictions \n                governing abortion policy and extends those \n                restrictions to the newly created health insurance \n                exchanges. Under the Act, longstanding Federal laws to \n                protect conscience (such as the Church Amendment, 42 \n                U.S.C. 300a-7, and the Weldon Amendment, section \n                508(d)(1) of Public Law 111-8) remain intact and new \n                protections prohibit discrimination against health care \n                facilities and health care providers because of an \n                unwillingness to provide, pay for, provide coverage of, \n                or refer for abortions.\n\n                Numerous executive agencies have a role in ensuring \n                that these restrictions are enforced, including the \n                Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the \n                Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the Office \n                of Personnel Management.\n\n                Sec. 2.  Strict Compliance with Prohibitions on \n                Abortion Funding in Health Insurance Exchanges. The Act \n                specifically prohibits the use of tax credits and cost-\n                sharing reduction payments to pay for abortion services \n                (except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of \n                the woman would be endangered) in the health insurance \n                exchanges that will be operational in 2014. The Act \n                also imposes strict payment and accounting requirements \n                to ensure that Federal funds are not used for abortion \n                services in exchange plans (except in cases of rape or \n                incest, or when the life of the woman would be \n                endangered) and requires State health insurance \n                commissioners to ensure that exchange plan funds are \n                segregated by insurance companies in accordance with \n                generally accepted accounting principles, OMB funds \n                management circulars, and accounting guidance provided \n                by the Government Accountability Office.\n\n                I hereby direct the Director of the OMB and the \n                Secretary of HHS to develop, within 180 days of the \n                date of this order, a model set of segregation \n                guidelines for State health insurance commissioners to \n                use when determining whether exchange plans are \n                complying with the Act's segregation requirements, \n                established in section 1303 of the Act, for enrollees \n                receiving Federal financial assistance. The guidelines \n                shall also offer technical information that States \n                should follow to conduct independent regular audits of \n                insurance companies that participate in the health \n                insurance exchanges. In developing these model \n                guidelines, the Director of the OMB and the Secretary \n                of HHS shall consult with executive agencies and \n                offices that have relevant expertise in accounting\n\n[[Page 15600]]\n\n                principles, including, but not limited to, the \n                Department of the Treasury, and with the Government \n                Accountability Office. Upon completion of those model \n                guidelines, the Secretary of HHS should promptly \n                initiate a rulemaking to issue regulations, which will \n                have the force of law, to interpret the Act's \n                segregation requirements, and shall provide guidance to \n                State health insurance commissioners on how to comply \n                with the model guidelines.\n\n                Sec. 3. Community Health Center Program. The Act \n                establishes a new Community Health Center (CHC) Fund \n                within HHS, which provides additional Federal funds for \n                the community health center program. Existing law \n                prohibits these centers from using Federal funds to \n                provide abortion services (except in cases of rape or \n                incest, or when the life of the woman would be \n                endangered), as a result of both the Hyde Amendment and \n                longstanding regulations containing the Hyde language. \n                Under the Act, the Hyde language shall apply to the \n                authorization and appropriations of funds for Community \n                Health Centers under section 10503 and all other \n                relevant provisions. I hereby direct the Secretary of \n                HHS to ensure that program administrators and \n                recipients of Federal funds are aware of and comply \n                with the limitations on abortion services imposed on \n                CHCs by existing law. Such actions should include, but \n                are not limited to, updating Grant Policy Statements \n                that accompany CHC grants and issuing new interpretive \n                rules.\n\n                Sec. 4.

The Federal Government can \npreserve these fundamental commitments while empowering faith-based and \nneighborhood organizations to deliver vital services in our communities, \nfrom providing mentors and tutors to school children to giving ex-offenders \na second chance at work and a responsible life to ensuring that families \nare fed.

Policy.\n\n                    (a) The information technology revolution has \n                changed the way business is transacted, government \n                operates, and national defense is conducted. Those \n                three functions now depend on an interdependent network \n                of critical information infrastructures. The protection \n                program authorized by this order shall consist of \n                continuous efforts to secure information systems for \n                critical infrastructure, including emergency \n                preparedness communications, and the physical assets \n                that support such systems. Protection of these systems \n                is essential to the telecommunications, energy, \n                financial services, manufacturing, water, \n                transportation, health care, and emergency services \n                sectors.\n                    (b) It is the policy of the United States to \n                protect against disruption of the operation of \n                information systems for critical infrastructure and \n                thereby help to protect the people, economy, essential \n                human and government services, and national security of \n                the United States, and to ensure that any disruptions \n                that occur are infrequent, of minimal duration, and \n                manageable, and cause the least damage possible. The \n                implementation of this policy shall include a voluntary \n                public-private partnership, involving corporate and \n                nongovernmental organizations.\n\n                Sec. 2. Scope. To achieve this policy, there shall be a \n                senior executive branch board to coordinate and have \n                cognizance of Federal efforts and programs that relate \n                to protection of information systems and involve:\n\n                    (a) cooperation with and protection of private \n                sector critical infrastructure, State and local \n                governments' critical infrastructure, and supporting \n                programs in corporate and academic organizations;\n                    (b) protection of Federal departments' and \n                agencies' critical infrastructure; and\n                    (c) related national security programs.\n\n                Sec. 3. Establishment. I hereby establish the \n                ``President's Critical Infrastructure Protection \n                Board'' (the ``Board'').\n\n                Sec. 4. Continuing Authorities. This order does not \n                alter the existing authorities or roles of United \n                States Government departments and agencies. Authorities \n                set forth in 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35, and other applicable \n                law, provide senior officials with responsibility for \n                the security of Federal Government information systems.\n\n                    (a) Executive Branch Information Systems Security. \n                The Director of the Office of Management and Budget \n                (OMB) has the responsibility to develop and oversee the \n                implementation of government-wide policies, principles, \n                standards, and guidelines for the security of \n                information systems that support the executive branch \n                departments and agencies, except those noted in section \n                4(b) of this order. The Director of OMB shall advise \n                the President and the appropriate department or agency \n                head when there is a critical deficiency in the \n                security practices within the purview of this section \n                in an executive branch department or agency. The Board \n                shall assist and support the Director\n\n[[Page 53064]]\n\n                of OMB in this function and shall be reasonably \n                cognizant of programs related to security of department \n                and agency information systems.\n                    (b) National Security Information Systems. The \n                Secretary of Defense and the Director of Central \n                Intelligence (DCI) shall have responsibility to \n                oversee, develop, and ensure implementation of \n                policies, principles, standards, and guidelines for the \n                security of information systems that support the \n                operations under their respective control. In \n                consultation with the Assistant to the President for \n                National Security Affairs and the affected departments \n                and agencies, the Secretary of Defense and the DCI \n                shall develop policies, principles, standards, and \n                guidelines for the security of national security \n                information systems that support the operations of \n                other executive branch departments and agencies with \n                national security information.\n\n(i)\n\n Policies, principles, standards, and guidelines developed under this \nsubsection may require more stringent protection than those developed in \naccordance with subsection 4(a) of this order.\n\n(ii)\n\n The Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs shall advise \nthe President and the appropriate department or agency head when there is a \ncritical deficiency in the security practices of a department or agency \nwithin the purview of this section. The Board, or one of its standing or ad \nhoc committees, shall be reasonably cognizant of programs to provide \nsecurity and continuity to national security information systems.\n\n                    (c) Additional Responsibilities: The Heads of \n                Executive Branch Departments and Agencies. The heads of \n                executive branch departments and agencies are \n                responsible and accountable for providing and \n                maintaining adequate levels of security for information \n                systems, including emergency preparedness \n                communications systems, for programs under their \n                control. Heads of such departments and agencies shall \n                ensure the development and, within available \n                appropriations, funding of programs that adequately \n                address these mission areas. Cost-effective security \n                shall be built into and made an integral part of \n                government information systems, especially those \n                critical systems that support the national security and \n                other essential government programs. Additionally, \n                security should enable, and not unnecessarily impede, \n                department and agency business operations.\n\n                Sec. 5. Board Responsibilities. Consistent with the \n                responsibilities noted in section 4 of this order, the \n                Board shall recommend policies and coordinate programs \n                for protecting information systems for critical \n                infrastructure, including emergency preparedness \n                communications, and the physical assets that support \n                such systems. Among its activities to implement these \n                responsibilities, the Board shall:\n\n                    (a) Outreach to the Private Sector and State and \n                Local Governments.

Scope and Purpose. (a) The periodic review \n                described in section 3 of this order applies only to \n                those detainees held at Guant[aacute]namo on the date \n                of this order, whom the interagency review established \n                by Executive Order 13492 has (i) designated for \n                continued law of war detention; or (ii) referred for \n                prosecution, except for those detainees against whom \n                charges are pending or a judgment of conviction has \n                been entered.\n\n                    (b) This order is intended solely to establish, as \n                a discretionary matter, a process to review on a \n                periodic basis the executive branch's continued, \n                discretionary exercise of existing detention authority \n                in individual cases. It does not create any additional \n                or separate source of detention authority, and it does \n                not affect the scope of detention authority under \n                existing law. Detainees at Guant[aacute]namo have the \n                constitutional privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, \n                and nothing in this order is intended to affect the \n                jurisdiction of Federal courts to determine the \n                legality of their detention.\n                    (c) In the event detainees covered by this order \n                are transferred from Guant[aacute]namo to another U.S. \n                detention facility where they remain in law of war \n                detention, this order shall continue to apply to them.\n\n                Sec. 2. Standard for Continued Detention. Continued law \n                of war detention is warranted for a detainee subject to \n                the periodic review in section 3 of this order if it is \n                necessary to protect against a significant threat to \n                the security of the United States.\n\n                Sec. 3. Periodic Review. The Secretary of Defense shall \n                coordinate a process of periodic review of continued \n                law of war detention for each detainee described in \n                section 1(a) of this order. In consultation with the \n                Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense shall issue \n                implementing guidelines governing the process, \n                consistent with the following requirements:\n\n                    (a) Initial Review. For each detainee, an initial \n                review shall commence as soon as possible but no later \n                than 1 year from the date of this order. The initial \n                review will consist of a hearing before a Periodic \n                Review Board (PRB). The review and hearing shall follow \n                a process that includes the following requirements:\n\n(1) Each detainee shall be provided, in writing and in a language the \ndetainee understands, with advance notice of the PRB review and an \nunclassified summary of the factors and information the PRB will consider \nin evaluating whether the detainee meets the standard set forth in section \n2 of this order. The written summary shall be sufficiently comprehensive to \nprovide adequate notice to the detainee of the reasons for continued \ndetention.\n\n[[Page 13278]]\n\n(2) The detainee shall be assisted in proceedings before the PRB by a \nGovernment-provided personal representative (representative) who possesses \nthe security clearances necessary for access to the information described \nin subsection (a)(4) of this section. The representative shall advocate on \nbehalf of the detainee before the PRB and shall be responsible for \nchallenging the Government's information and introducing information on \nbehalf of the detainee. In addition to the representative, the detainee may \nbe assisted in proceedings before the PRB by private counsel, at no expense \nto the Government.\n\n(3) The detainee shall be permitted to (i) present to the PRB a written or \noral statement; (ii) introduce relevant information, including written \ndeclarations; (iii) answer any questions posed by the PRB; and (iv) call \nwitnesses who are reasonably available and willing to provide information \nthat is relevant and material to the standard set forth in section 2 of \nthis order.\n\n(4) The Secretary of Defense, in coordination with other relevant \nGovernment agencies, shall compile and provide to the PRB all information \nin the detainee disposition recommendations produced by the Task Force \nestablished under Executive Order 13492 that is relevant to the \ndetermination whether the standard in section 2 of this order has been met \nand on which the Government seeks to rely for that determination. In \naddition, the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with other relevant \nGovernment agencies, shall compile any additional information relevant to \nthat determination, and on which the Government seeks to rely for that \ndetermination, that has become available since the conclusion of the \nExecutive Order 13492 review. All mitigating information relevant to that \ndetermination must be provided to the PRB.\n\n(5) The information provided in subsection (a)(4) of this section shall be \nprovided to the detainee's representative. In exceptional circumstances \nwhere it is necessary to protect national security, including intelligence \nsources and methods, the PRB may determine that the representative must \nreceive a sufficient substitute or summary, rather than the underlying \ninformation. If the detainee is represented by private counsel, the \ninformation provided in subsection (a)(4) of this section shall be provided \nto such counsel unless the Government determines that the need to protect \nnational security, including intelligence sources and methods, or law \nenforcement or privilege concerns, requires the Government to provide \ncounsel with a sufficient substitute or summary of the information. A \nsufficient substitute or summary must provide a meaningful opportunity to \nassist the detainee during the review process.\n\n(6) The PRB shall conduct a hearing to consider the information described \nin subsection (a)(4) of this section, and other relevant information \nprovided by the detainee or the detainee's representative or counsel, to \ndetermine whether the standard in section 2 of this order is met. The PRB \nshall consider the reliability of any information provided to it in making \nits determination.\n\n(7) The PRB shall make a prompt determination, by consensus and in writing, \nas to whether the detainee's continued detention is warranted under the \nstandard in section 2 of this order. If the PRB determines that the \nstandard is not met, the PRB shall also recommend any conditions that \nrelate to the detainee's transfer. The PRB shall provide a written summary \nof any final determination in unclassified form to the detainee, in a \nlanguage the detainee understands, within 30 days of the determination when \npracticable.\n\n(8) The Secretary of Defense shall establish a secretariat to administer \nthe PRB review and hearing process. The Director of National Intelligence \nshall assist in preparing the unclassified notice and the substitutes or \nsummaries described above. Other executive departments and agencies shall \nassist in the process of providing the PRB with information required for \nthe review processes detailed in this order.\n\n[[Page 13279]]\n\n                    (b) Subsequent Full Review. The continued detention \n                of each detainee shall be subject to subsequent full \n                reviews and hearings by the PRB on a triennial basis. \n                Each subsequent review shall employ the procedures set \n                forth in section 3(a) of this order.\n                    (c) File Reviews. The continued detention of each \n                detainee shall also be subject to a file review every 6 \n                months in the intervening years between full reviews. \n                This file review will be conducted by the PRB and shall \n                consist of a review of any relevant new information \n                related to the detainee compiled by the Secretary of \n                Defense, in coordination with other relevant agencies, \n                since the last review and, as appropriate, information \n                considered during any prior PRB review. The detainee \n                shall be permitted to make a written submission in \n                connection with each file review. If, during the file \n                review, a significant question is raised as to whether \n                the detainee's continued detention is warranted under \n                the standard in section 2 of this order, the PRB will \n                promptly convene a full review pursuant to the \n                standards in section 3(a) of this order.\n                    (d) Review of PRB Determinations. The Review \n                Committee (Committee), as defined in section 9(d) of \n                this order, shall conduct a review if (i) a member of \n                the Committee seeks review of a PRB determination \n                within 30 days of that determination; or (ii) consensus \n                within the PRB cannot be reached.\n\n                Sec. 4. Effect of Determination to Transfer. (a) If a \n                final determination is made that a detainee does not \n                meet the standard in section 2 of this order, the \n                Secretaries of State and Defense shall be responsible \n                for ensuring that vigorous efforts are undertaken to \n                identify a suitable transfer location for any such \n                detainee, outside of the United States, consistent with \n                the national security and foreign policy interests of \n                the United States and the commitment set forth in \n                section 2242(a) of the Foreign Affairs Reform and \n                Restructuring Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-277).\n\n                    (b) The Secretary of State, in consultation with \n                the Secretary of Defense, shall be responsible for \n                obtaining appropriate security and humane treatment \n                assurances regarding any detainee to be transferred to \n                another country, and for determining, after \n                consultation with members of the Committee, that it is \n                appropriate to proceed with the transfer.\n                    (c) The Secretary of State shall evaluate humane \n                treatment assurances in all cases, consistent with the \n                recommendations of the Special Task Force on \n                Interrogation and Transfer Policies established by \n                Executive Order 13491 of January 22, 2009.\n\n                Sec. 5. Annual Committee Review. (a) The Committee \n                shall conduct an annual review of sufficiency and \n                efficacy of transfer efforts, including:\n\n(1) the status of transfer efforts for any detainee who has been subject to \nthe periodic review under section 3 of this order, whose continued \ndetention has been determined not to be warranted, and who has not been \ntransferred more than 6 months after the date of such determination;\n\n(2) the status of transfer efforts for any detainee whose petition for a \nwrit of habeas corpus has been granted by a U.S. Federal court with no \npending appeal and who has not been transferred;\n\n(3) the status of transfer efforts for any detainee who has been designated \nfor transfer or conditional detention by the Executive Order 13492 review \nand who has not been transferred; and\n\n(4) the security and other conditions in the countries to which detainees \nmight be transferred, including a review of any suspension of transfers to \na particular country, in order to determine whether further steps to \nfacilitate transfers are appropriate or to provide a recommendation to the \nPresident regarding whether continuation of any such suspension is \nwarranted.\n\n                    (b) After completion of the initial reviews under \n                section 3(a) of this order, and at least once every 4 \n                years thereafter, the Committee shall review\n\n[[Page 13280]]\n\n                whether a continued law of war detention policy remains \n                consistent with the interests of the United States, \n                including national security interests.\n\n                Sec. 6. Continuing Obligation of the Departments of \n                Justice and Defense to Assess Feasibility of \n                Prosecution. As to each detainee whom the interagency \n                review established by Executive Order 13492 has \n                designated for continued law of war detention, the \n                Attorney General and the Secretary of Defense shall \n                continue to assess whether prosecution of the detainee \n                is feasible and in the national security interests of \n                the United States, and shall refer detainees for \n                prosecution, as appropriate.\n\n                Sec. 7.

All departments, \n                agencies, entities, and officers of the United States, \n                to the maximum extent permitted by law, shall provide \n                the Secretary of Defense such assistance as may be \n                requested to implement this order.\n\n                Sec. 8. Legality of Detention. The process established \n                under this order does not address the legality of any \n                detainee's law of war detention. If, at any time during \n                the periodic review process established in this order, \n                material information calls into question the legality \n                of detention, the matter will be referred immediately \n                to the Secretary of Defense and the Attorney General \n                for appropriate action.\n\n                Sec. 9.

Policy. Research involving human embryonic \n                stem cells and human non-embryonic stem cells has the \n                potential to lead to better understanding and treatment \n                of many disabling diseases and conditions. Advances \n                over the past decade in this promising scientific field \n                have been encouraging, leading to broad agreement in \n                the scientific community that the research should be \n                supported by Federal funds.\n\n                For the past 8 years, the authority of the Department \n                of Health and Human Services, including the National \n                Institutes of Health (NIH), to fund and conduct human \n                embryonic stem cell research has been limited by \n                Presidential actions. The purpose of this order is to \n                remove these limitations on scientific inquiry, to \n                expand NIH support for the exploration of human stem \n                cell research, and in so doing to enhance the \n                contribution of America's scientists to important new \n                discoveries and new therapies for the benefit of \n                humankind.\n\n                Sec. 2. Research. The Secretary of Health and Human \n                Services (Secretary), through the Director of NIH, may \n                support and conduct responsible, scientifically worthy \n                human stem cell research, including human embryonic \n                stem cell research, to the extent permitted by law.\n\n                Sec. 3. Guidance. Within 120 days from the date of this \n                order, the Secretary, through the Director of NIH, \n                shall review existing NIH guidance and other widely \n                recognized guidelines on human stem cell research, \n                including provisions establishing appropriate \n                safeguards, and issue new NIH guidance on such research \n                that is consistent with this order. The Secretary, \n                through NIH, shall review and update such guidance \n                periodically, as appropriate.\n\n                Sec. 4. General Provisions.

Establishment. There is established within \n                the Executive Office of the President the National \n                Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform \n                (Commission).\n\n                Sec. 2. Membership. The Commission shall be composed of \n                18 members who shall be selected as follows:\n\n                    (a) six members appointed by the President, not \n                more than four of whom shall be from the same political \n                party;\n                    (b) three members selected by the Majority Leader \n                of the Senate, all of whom shall be current Members of \n                the Senate;\n                    (c) three members selected by the Speaker of the \n                House of Representatives, all of whom shall be current \n                Members of the House of Representatives;\n                    (d) three members selected by the Minority Leader \n                of the Senate, all of whom shall be current Members of \n                the Senate; and\n                    (e) three members selected by the Minority Leader \n                of the House of Representatives, all of whom shall be \n                current Members of the House of Representatives.\n\n                Sec. 3. Co-Chairs. From among his appointees, the \n                President shall designate two members, who shall not be \n                of the same political party, to serve as Co-Chairs of \n                the Commission.\n\n                Sec. 4. Mission. The Commission is charged with \n                identifying policies to improve the fiscal situation in \n                the medium term and to achieve fiscal sustainability \n                over the long run. Specifically, the Commission shall \n                propose recommendations designed to balance the budget, \n                excluding interest payments on the debt, by 2015. This \n                result is projected to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio \n                at an acceptable level once the economy recovers. The \n                magnitude and timing of the policy measures necessary \n                to achieve this goal are subject to considerable \n                uncertainty and will depend on the evolution of the \n                economy. In addition, the Commission shall propose \n                recommendations that meaningfully improve the long-run \n                fiscal outlook, including changes to address the growth \n                of entitlement spending and the gap between the \n                projected revenues and expenditures of the Federal \n                Government.\n\n                Sec. 5. Reports. (a) No later than December 1, 2010, \n                the Commission shall vote on the approval of a final \n                report containing a set of recommendations to achieve \n                the mission set forth in section 4 of this order.\n\n                    (b) The issuance of a final report of the \n                Commission shall require the approval of not less than \n                14 of the 18 members of the Commission.\n\n                Sec. 6. Administration. (a) Members of the Commission \n                shall serve without any additional compensation, but \n                shall be allowed travel expenses, including per diem in \n                lieu of subsistence, as authorized by law for persons \n                serving intermittently in Government service (5 U.S.C. \n                5701-5707), consistent with the availability of funds.\n\n                    (b) The Commission shall have a staff headed by an \n                Executive Director.\n\n[[Page 7928]]\n\n                Sec. 7.

Policy. Shortages of pharmaceutical drugs \n                pose a serious and growing threat to public health. \n                While a very small number of drugs in the United States \n                experience a shortage in any given year, the number of \n                prescription drug shortages in the United States nearly \n                tripled between 2005 and 2010, and shortages are \n                becoming more severe as well as more frequent. The \n                affected medicines include cancer treatments, \n                anesthesia drugs, and other drugs that are critical to \n                the treatment and prevention of serious diseases and \n                life-threatening conditions.\n\n                For example, over approximately the last 5 years, data \n                indicates that the use of sterile injectable cancer \n                treatments has increased by about 20 percent, without a \n                corresponding increase in production capacity. While \n                manufacturers are currently in the process of expanding \n                capacity, it may be several years before production \n                capacity has been significantly increased. \n                Interruptions in the supplies of these drugs endanger \n                patient safety and burden doctors, hospitals, \n                pharmacists, and patients. They also increase health \n                care costs, particularly because some participants in \n                the market may use shortages as opportunities to hoard \n                scarce drugs or charge exorbitant prices.\n\n                The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the \n                Department of Health and Human Services has been \n                working diligently to address this problem through its \n                existing regulatory framework. While the root problems \n                and many of their solutions are outside of the FDA's \n                control, the agency has worked cooperatively with \n                manufacturers to prevent or mitigate shortages by \n                expediting review of certain regulatory submissions and \n                adopting a flexible approach to drug manufacturing and \n                importation regulations where appropriate. As a result, \n                the FDA prevented 137 drug shortages in 2010 and 2011. \n                Despite these successes, however, the problem of drug \n                shortages has continued to grow.\n\n                Many different factors contribute to drug shortages, \n                and solving this critical public health problem will \n                require a multifaceted approach. An important factor in \n                many of the recent shortages appears to be an increase \n                in demand that exceeds current manufacturing capacity. \n                While manufacturers are in the process of expanding \n                capacity, one important step is ensuring that the FDA \n                and the public receive adequate advance notice of \n                shortages whenever possible. The FDA cannot begin to \n                work with manufacturers or use the other tools at its \n                disposal until it knows there is a potential problem. \n                Similarly, early disclosure of a shortage can help \n                hospitals, doctors, and patients make alternative \n                arrangements before a shortage becomes a crisis. \n                However, drug manufacturers have not consistently \n                provided the FDA with adequate notice of potential \n                shortages.\n\n                As part of my Administration's broader effort to work \n                with manufacturers, health care providers, and other \n                stakeholders to prevent drug shortages, this order \n                directs the FDA to take steps that will help to prevent \n                and reduce current and future disruptions in the supply \n                of lifesaving medicines.\n\n                Sec. 2. Broader Reporting of Manufacturing \n                Discontinuances. To the extent permitted by law, the \n                FDA shall use all appropriate administrative tools, \n                including its authority to interpret and administer the \n                reporting requirements in 21 U.S.C. 356c, to require \n                drug manufacturers to provide adequate advance\n\n[[Page 68296]]\n\n                notice of manufacturing discontinuances that could lead \n                to shortages of drugs that are life-supporting or life-\n                sustaining, or that prevent debilitating disease.\n\n                Sec. 3. Expedited Regulatory Review. To the extent \n                practicable, and consistent with its statutory \n                responsibility to ensure the safety and effectiveness \n                of the drug supply, the FDA shall take steps to expand \n                its current efforts to expedite its regulatory reviews, \n                including reviews of new drug suppliers, manufacturing \n                sites, and manufacturing changes, whenever it \n                determines that expedited review would help to avoid or \n                mitigate existing or potential drug shortages. In \n                prioritizing and allocating its limited resources, the \n                FDA should consider both the severity of the shortage \n                and the importance of the affected drug to public \n                health.\n\n                Sec. 4. Review of Certain Behaviors by Market \n                Participants.

It may also examine \n                broader issues not linked to specific technologies, \n                including but not limited to the protection of human \n                research participants; scientific integrity and \n                conflicts of interest in research; and the intersection \n                of science and human rights.\n\n                (c) The Commission shall not be responsible for the \n                review and approval of specific projects.\n\n                (d) The Commission may accept suggestions of issues for \n                consideration from executive departments and agencies \n                and the public as it deems appropriate in support of \n                its mission.\n\n                (e) In establishing priorities for its activities, the \n                Commission shall consider, among other things, the \n                significance of particular issues; the need for legal, \n                regulatory, and policy guidance with respect to such \n                issues; the connection of the issues to the goal of \n                Federal advancement of science and technology; and the \n                availability of other appropriate entities or fora for \n                deliberating on the issues.\n\n                (f) The Commission is authorized to conduct original \n                empirical and conceptual research, commission papers \n                and studies, hold hearings, and establish committees \n                and subcommittees, as necessary. The Commission is \n                authorized to develop reports or other materials.\n\n                Sec. 3.

Policy. There is a unique relationship \n                between the United States and Indian tribes, and a \n                special relationship between the United States and \n                Alaska Native entities. It is the policy of the Federal \n                Government that this Nation's commitment to educational \n                excellence and opportunity must extend as well to the \n                tribal colleges and universities (tribal colleges) that \n                serve Indian tribes and Alaska Native entities. The \n                President's Board of Advisors on Tribal Colleges and \n                Universities (the ``Board'') and the White House \n                Initiative on Tribal Colleges and Universities (WHITCU) \n                established by this order shall ensure that this \n                national policy regarding tribal colleges is carried \n                out with direct accountability at the highest levels of \n                the Federal Government.\n\n                Tribal colleges are both integral and essential to \n                their communities. Often they are the only \n                postsecondary institutions within some of our Nation's \n                poorest rural areas. They fulfill a vital role: in \n                maintaining and preserving irreplaceable languages and \n                cultural traditions; in offering a high-quality college \n                education to younger students; and in providing job \n                training and other career-building programs to adults \n                and senior citizens. Tribal colleges provide crucial \n                services in communities that continue to suffer high \n                rates of unemployment and the resulting social and \n                economic distress.\n\n                The Federal Government's commitment to tribal colleges \n                is reaffirmed and the private sector can and should \n                contribute to the colleges' educational and cultural \n                missions.\n\n                Finally, postsecondary institutions can play a vital \n                role in promoting excellence in early childhood, \n                elementary, and secondary education. The Federal \n                Government will therefore work to implement the \n                innovations and reforms of the No Child Left Behind Act \n                of 2001 (Public Law 107-110) in partnership with tribal \n                colleges and their American Indian and Alaska Native \n                communities.\n\n                Sec. 2. Definition of Tribal Colleges and Universities. \n                Tribal colleges are those institutions cited in section \n                532 of the Equity in Educational Land-Grant Status Act \n                of 1994 (7 U.S.C. 301 note), any other institution that \n                qualifies for funding under the Tribally Controlled \n                Community College Assistance Act of 1978 (25 U.S.C. \n                1801 et seq.), and Din[eacute] College, authorized in \n                the Navajo Community College Assistance Act of 1978, \n                Public Law 95-471, title II (25 U.S.C. 640a note).\n\n                Sec. 3. Board of Advisors. (a) Establishment. There \n                shall be established in the Department of Education a \n                Presidential advisory committee entitled the \n                President's Board of Advisors on Tribal Colleges and \n                Universities (the ``Board'').\n\n                    (b) Membership. The Board shall consist of not more \n                than 15 members who shall be appointed by the \n                President, one of whom shall be designated by the \n                President as Chair. The Board shall include \n                representatives of tribal colleges and may also include \n                representatives of the higher, early childhood, \n                elementary, and secondary education communities; tribal \n                officials; health, business, and financial \n                institutions; private foundations; and such other \n                persons as the President deems appropriate.\n\n[[Page 45289]]\n\n                    (c) Functions. The Board shall provide advice \n                regarding the progress made by Federal agencies toward \n                fulfilling the purposes and objectives of this order. \n                The Board also shall provide recommendations to the \n                President, through the Secretary of Education \n                (Secretary), on ways the Federal Government can help \n                tribal colleges:\n\n  (1) use long-term development, endowment building, and planning to \nstrengthen institutional viability;\n\n  (2) improve financial management and security, obtain private-sector \nfunding support, and expand and complement Federal education initiatives;\n\n  (3) develop institutional capacity through the use of new and emerging \ntechnologies offered by both the Federal and private sectors;\n\n  (4) enhance physical infrastructure to facilitate more efficient \noperation and effective recruitment and retention of students and faculty; \nand\n\n  (5) help implement the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 and meet other \nhigh standards of educational achievement.\n\n                    (d) Meetings. The Board shall meet at least \n                annually, at the request of the Secretary, to provide \n                advice and consultation on tribal colleges and relevant \n                Federal and private-sector activities, and to transmit \n                reports and present recommendations.\n\n                Sec. 4. White House Initiative on Tribal Colleges and \n                Universities. There shall be established in the \n                Department of Education, Office of the Secretary, the \n                White House Initiative on Tribal Colleges and \n                Universities (WHITCU). The WHITCU shall:\n\n                    (a) provide the staff support for the Board;\n                    (b) assist the Secretary in the role of liaison \n                between the executive branch and tribal colleges; and\n                    (c) serve the Secretary in carrying out the \n                Secretary's responsibilities under this order.\n\n                 Sec. 5. Department and Agency Participation. Each \n                participating executive department and agency (agency), \n                as determined by the Secretary, shall appoint a senior \n                official who is a full-time officer of the Federal \n                Government and who is responsible for management or \n                program administration. The official shall report \n                directly to the agency head, or to the agency head's \n                designee, on agency activity under this order and serve \n                as liaison to the WHITCU. To the extent permitted by \n                law and regulation, each agency shall provide \n                appropriate information as requested by the WHITCU \n                staff pursuant to this order.\n\n                Sec. 6. Three-Year Federal Plan.\n\n                    (a) Content. Each agency identified by the \n                Secretary shall develop and implement a Three-Year Plan \n                of the agency's efforts to fulfill the purposes of this \n                order. These Three-Year Plans shall include annual \n                performance indicators and appropriate measurable \n                objectives for the agency. Among other relevant issues, \n                the plans shall address how the agency intends to \n                increase the capacity of tribal colleges to compete \n                effectively for any available grants, contracts, \n                cooperative agreements, and any other Federal \n                resources, and to encourage tribal colleges to \n                participate in Federal programs. The plans also may \n                emphasize access to high-quality educational \n                opportunities for economically disadvantaged Indian \n                students, consistent with requirements of the No Child \n                Left Behind Act of 2001; the preservation and \n                revitalization of tribal languages and cultural \n                traditions; and innovative approaches to better link \n                tribal colleges with early childhood, elementary, and \n                secondary education programs. The agency's performance \n                indicators and objectives should be clearly reflected \n                in the agency's annual budget submission to the Office \n                of Management and Budget. To facilitate the attainment \n                of these performance indicators and objectives, the \n                head of each agency identified by the Secretary, shall \n                provide, as appropriate, technical assistance and \n                information to tribal colleges regarding the program \n                activities of the agency\n\n[[Page 45290]]\n\n                and the preparation of applications or proposals for \n                grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements.\n                    (b) Submission. Each agency shall submit its Three-\n                Year Plan to the WHITCU. In consultation with the \n                Board, the WHITCU shall then review these Three-Year \n                Plans and develop an integrated Three-Year Plan for \n                Assistance to Tribal Colleges, which the Secretary \n                shall review and submit to the President. Agencies may \n                revise their Three-Year Plans within the three-year \n                period.\n                    (c) Annual Performance Reports. Each agency shall \n                submit to the WHITCU an Annual Performance Report that \n                measures the agency's performance against the \n                objectives set forth in its Three-Year Plan. In \n                consultation with the Board, the WHITCU shall review \n                and combine Annual Performance Reports into one annual \n                report, which shall be submitted to the Secretary for \n                review, in consultation with the Office of Management \n                and Budget.\n\n                Sec. 7. Private Sector. In cooperation with the Board, \n                the WHITCU shall encourage the private sector to assist \n                tribal colleges through increased use of such \n                strategies as:\n\n                    (a) matching funds to support increased endowments;\n                    (b) developing expertise and more effective ways to \n                manage finances, improve information systems, build \n                facilities, and improve course offerings; and\n                    (c) increasing resources for and training of \n                faculty.\n\n                Sec. 8. Termination.

Policy. It is the policy of the Federal \n                Government to be judicious in the expenditure of \n                taxpayer dollars. To ensure the proper use of taxpayer \n                funds that are appropriated for Government programs and \n                purposes, it is necessary that the number and cost of \n                earmarks be reduced, that their origin and purposes be \n                transparent, and that they be included in the text of \n                the bills voted upon by the Congress and presented to \n                the President. For appropriations laws and other \n                legislation enacted after the date of this order, \n                executive agencies should not commit, obligate, or \n                expend funds on the basis of earmarks included in any \n                non-statutory source, including requests in reports of \n                committees of the Congress or other congressional \n                documents, or communications from or on behalf of \n                Members of Congress, or any other non-statutory source, \n                except when required by law or when an agency has \n                itself determined a project, program, activity, grant, \n                or other transaction to have merit under statutory \n                criteria or other merit-based decisionmaking.\n\n                Sec. 2. Duties of Agency Heads. (a) With respect to all \n                appropriations laws and other legislation enacted after \n                the date of this order, the head of each agency shall \n                take all necessary steps to ensure that:\n\n(i) agency decisions to commit, obligate, or expend funds for any earmark \nare based on the text of laws, and in particular, are not based on language \nin any report of a committee of Congress, joint explanatory statement of a \ncommittee of conference of the Congress, statement of managers concerning a \nbill in the Congress, or any other non-statutory statement or indication of \nviews of the Congress, or a House, committee, Member, officer, or staff \nthereof;\n\n(ii) agency decisions to commit, obligate, or expend funds for any earmark \nare based on authorized, transparent, statutory criteria and merit-based \ndecision making, in the manner set forth in section II of OMB Memorandum M-\n07-10, dated February 15, 2007, to the extent consistent with applicable \nlaw; and\n\n(iii) no oral or written communications concerning earmarks shall supersede \nstatutory criteria, competitive awards, or merit-based decisionmaking.\n\n                (b) An agency shall not consider the views of a House, \n                committee, Member, officer, or staff of the Congress \n                with respect to commitments, obligations, or \n                expenditures to carry out any earmark unless such views \n                are in writing, to facilitate consideration in \n                accordance with section 2(a)(ii) above. All written \n                communications from the Congress, or a House, \n                committee, Member, officer, or staff thereof, \n                recommending that funds be committed, obligated, or \n                expended on any earmark shall be made publicly \n                available on the Internet by the receiving agency, not \n                later than 30 days after receipt of such communication, \n                unless otherwise specifically directed by the head of \n                the agency, without delegation, after consultation with \n                the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, to \n                preserve appropriate confidentiality between the \n                executive and legislative branches.\n\n[[Page 6418]]\n\n                (c) Heads of agencies shall otherwise implement within \n                their respective agencies the policy set forth in \n                section 1 of this order, consistent with such \n                instructions as the Director of the Office of \n                Management and Budget may prescribe.\n\n                (d) The head of each agency shall upon request provide \n                to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget \n                information about earmarks and compliance with this \n                order.\n\n                Sec. 3.

General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order \n                shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i) authority granted by law to an agency or the head thereof; or\n\n(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget \nrelating to budget, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n                (b) This order shall be implemented in a manner \n                consistent with applicable law and subject to the \n                availability of appropriations.\n\n                (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create \n                any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, \n                enforceable at law or in equity, by any party against \n                the United States, its agencies, instrumentalities, or \n                entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any \n                other person.\n                &lt;GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT&gt;\n                \n                    (Presidential Sig.)\n\n                THE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n                    January 29, 2008.\n\n[FR Doc. 08-483\nFiled 1-31-08; 9:02 am]\nBilling code 3195-01-P\n\n\n</pre>]","url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2008/02/01/08-483/protecting-american-taxpayers-from-government-spending-on-wasteful-earmarks","president":"bush","id":"13457"},"reftime":1418257660188}

(a) Any transaction by a United States person \n                or within the United States that evades or avoids, has \n                the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to \n                violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order \n                is prohibited.\n\n                (b)Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the \n                prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.\n\n                Sec. 3. For the purposes of this order:\n\n                (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;\n\n                (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, \n                association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, \n                subgroup, or other organization;\n\n                (c) the term ``United States person'' means any United \n                States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity \n                organized under the laws of the United States or any \n                jurisdiction within the United States (including \n                foreign branches), or any person in the United States; \n                and\n\n                (d) the term ``Government of Zimbabwe'' means the \n                Government of Zimbabwe, its agencies, \n                instrumentalities, and controlled entities.\n\n                Sec. 4. For those persons whose property and interests \n                in property are blocked pursuant to this order who \n                might have a constitutional presence in the United \n                States, I find that, because of the ability to transfer \n                funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to \n                such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this \n                order would render these measures ineffectual. I \n                therefore determine that, for these measures to be \n                effective in addressing the national emergency declared \n                in Executive Order 13288, there need be no prior notice \n                of a listing or determination made pursuant to section \n                1 of this order.\n\n                Sec. 5. The Secretary of the Treasury, after \n                consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby \n                authorized to take such actions, including the \n                promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ \n                all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be \n                necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The \n                Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these \n                functions to other officers and agencies of the United \n                States Government consistent with applicable law.

For purposes of this order:\n\n                (a) the term ``person'' means any individual or entity;\n\n                (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, \n                association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, \n                subgroup, or other organization; and\n\n                (c) the term ``United States person'' means any United \n                States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity \n                organized under the laws of the United States or any \n                jurisdiction within the United States (including \n                foreign branches), or any person in the United States.\n\n                Sec. 5. I hereby determine that the making of donations \n                of the type specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 \n                U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of, \n                persons whose property and interests in property are \n                blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would \n                seriously impair my ability to deal with the national \n                emergency declared in Executive Order 13338 and relied \n                upon for additional steps taken in Executive Order \n                13399 of April 25, 2006, and I hereby prohibit such \n                donations as provided by section 1 of this order.\n\n                Sec. 6. For those persons whose property and interests \n                in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this \n                order who might have a constitutional presence in the \n                United States, I find that, because of the ability to \n                transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior \n                notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant \n                to this order would render these measures ineffectual. \n                I therefore determine that for these measures to be \n                effective in addressing the national emergency declared \n                in Executive Order 13338 and relied upon for additional \n                steps taken in Executive Order 13399, there need be no \n                prior notice of a determination made pursuant to this \n                order.\n\n                Sec. 7. The Secretary of the Treasury, after \n                consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby \n                authorized to take such actions, including the \n                promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ \n                all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be \n                necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The \n                Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these \n                functions to other officers and agencies of the United \n                States Government, consistent with applicable law. All \n                executive agencies of the United States Government are \n                hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within \n                their authority to carry out the provisions of this \n                order and, where appropriate, to advise the Secretary \n                of the Treasury in a timely manner of the measures \n                taken.\n\n                Sec. 8. Nothing in this order is intended to affect the \n                continued effectiveness of any rules, regulations, \n                orders, licenses, or other forms of administrative \n                action issued, taken, or continued in effect heretofore \n                or hereafter under 31 C.F.R. chapter V, except as \n                expressly terminated, modified, or suspended by or \n                pursuant to this order.\n\n[[Page 8993]]\n\n                Sec. 9.

For the purposes of this order:\n\n                    (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or \n                entity;\n                    (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, \n                association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, \n                subgroup, or other organization;\n                    (c) the term ``United States person'' means any \n                United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity \n                organized under the laws of the United States or any \n                jurisdiction within the United States (including \n                foreign branches), or any person in the United States;\n                    (d) the term ``Government of Iran'' includes the \n                Government of Iran, any political subdivision, agency, \n                or instrumentality thereof, and any person owned or \n                controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, the \n                Government of Iran; and\n                    (e) the term ``family member'' means, with respect \n                to an individual, a spouse, child, parent, sibling, \n                grandchild, or grandparent of the individual.\n\n                Sec. 4. For those persons whose property and interests \n                in property are blocked pursuant to this order who \n                might have a constitutional presence in the United \n                States, I find that because of the ability to transfer \n                funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to \n                such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this \n                order would render those measures ineffectual. I \n                therefore determine that for these measures to be \n                effective in addressing the national emergency declared \n                in Executive Order 12957, there need be no prior notice \n                of a listing or determination made pursuant to section \n                1(a) of this order.\n\n                Sec. 5.

The Secretary of the \n                Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other \n                officers and agencies of the United States Government \n                consistent with applicable law. The Secretary of the \n                Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, \n                is hereby further authorized to exercise the functions \n                and waiver authorities conferred upon the President by \n                section 401(b) of CISADA (22 U.S.C. 8551(b)) with \n                respect to the requirement to impose or maintain \n                sanctions pursuant to IEEPA under section 105(a) of \n                CISADA (22 U.S.C. 8514(a)) and to redelegate these \n                functions and waiver authorities consistent with \n                applicable law. All agencies of the United States \n                Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate \n                measures within their authority to carry out the \n                provisions of this order.\n\n                Sec. 6. The Secretary of State is hereby authorized to \n                exercise the functions and authorities conferred upon \n                the President by section 105(a) of CISADA (22 U.S.C. \n                8514(a)) with respect to imposition of the visa \n                sanctions described in section 105(c) of CISADA (22 \n                U.S.C. 8514(c)) and to redelegate these functions and \n                authorities consistent with applicable law.

The Secretary of State is hereby \n                further authorized to exercise the functions and waiver \n                authorities conferred upon the President by section \n                401(b) of CISADA (22 U.S.C. 8551(b)) with respect to \n                the requirement to impose or maintain visa sanctions \n                under section 105(a) of CISADA (22 U.S.C. 8514(a)) and \n                to redelegate these functions and waiver authorities \n                consistent with applicable law. In exercising the \n                functions and authorities in the previous sentence, the \n                Secretary of State shall consult the Secretary of \n                Homeland Security on matters related to admissibility \n                or inadmissibility within the authority of the \n                Secretary of Homeland Security.\n\n                Sec. 7.

The Secretary of State, in \n                consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, is \n                hereby further authorized to exercise the functions and \n                waiver authorities conferred upon the President by \n                section 401(b) of CISADA (22 U.S.C. 8551(b)) with \n                respect to the requirement to include a person on the \n                list required by section 105(b) of CISADA (22 U.S.C. \n                8514(b)) and to redelegate these functions and waiver \n                authorities consistent with applicable law.\n\n                Sec. 8.

The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n                with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to \n                determine that circumstances no longer warrant the \n                blocking of the property and interests in property of a \n                person listed in the Annex to this order, and to take \n                necessary action to give effect to that determination.\n\n                Sec. 10.

Executive Order 12989 of February 13, 1996, \n                as amended, is further amended:\n\n                (a) by striking the title and inserting in lieu thereof \n                ``Economy and Efficiency in Government Procurement \n                Through Compliance with Certain Immigration and \n                Nationality Act Provisions and Use of an Electronic \n                Employment Eligibility Verification System''; and\n\n                (b) by striking the material that follows the title and \n                precedes section 1 of the order and inserting in lieu \n                thereof the following:\n\n                ``This order is designed to promote economy and \n                efficiency in Federal Government procurement. Stability \n                and dependability are important elements of economy and \n                efficiency. A contractor whose workforce is less stable \n                will be less likely to produce goods and services \n                economically and efficiently than a contractor whose \n                workforce is more stable. It is the policy of the \n                executive branch to enforce fully the immigration laws \n                of the United States, including the detection and \n                removal of illegal aliens and the imposition of legal \n                sanctions against employers that hire illegal aliens. \n                Because of the worksite enforcement policy of the \n                United States and the underlying obligation of the \n                executive branch to enforce the immigration laws, \n                contractors that employ illegal aliens cannot rely on \n                the continuing availability and service of those \n                illegal workers, and such contractors inevitably will \n                have a less stable and less dependable workforce than \n                contractors that do not employ such persons. Where a \n                contractor assigns illegal aliens to work on Federal \n                contracts, the enforcement of Federal immigration laws \n                imposes a direct risk of disruption, delay, and \n                increased expense in Federal contracting. Such \n                contractors are less dependable procurement sources, \n                even if they do not knowingly hire or knowingly \n                continue to employ unauthorized workers.\n\n                ``Contractors that adopt rigorous employment \n                eligibility confirmation policies are much less likely \n                to face immigration enforcement actions, because they \n                are less likely to employ unauthorized workers, and \n                they are therefore generally more efficient and \n                dependable procurement sources than contractors that do \n                not employ the best available measures to verify the \n                work eligibility of their workforce. It is the policy \n                of the executive branch to use an electronic employment \n                verification system because, among other reasons, it \n                provides the best available means to confirm the \n                identity and work eligibility of all employees that \n                join the Federal workforce. Private employers that \n                choose to contract with the Federal Government should \n                meet the same standard.\n\n                ``I find, therefore, that adherence to the general \n                policy of contracting only with providers that do not \n                knowingly employ unauthorized alien workers and that \n                have agreed to utilize an electronic employment \n                verification system designated by the Secretary of \n                Homeland Security to confirm the employment eligibility \n                of their workforce will promote economy and efficiency \n                in Federal procurement.\n\n[[Page 33286]]\n\n                ``NOW, THEREFORE, to ensure the economical and \n                efficient administration and completion of Federal \n                Government contracts, and by the authority vested in me \n                as President by the Constitution and the laws of the \n                United States of America, including subsection 121(a) \n                of title 40 and section 301 of title 3, United States \n                Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:''.\n\n                Sec. 2.

For the purposes of this order:\n\n                    (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or \n                entity;\n                    (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, \n                association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, \n                subgroup, or other organization;\n                    (c) the term ``United States person'' means any \n                United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity \n                organized under the laws of the United States or any \n                jurisdiction within the United States (including \n                foreign branches), or any person in the United States;\n                    (d) the term ``financial institution'' includes (i) \n                a depository institution (as defined in section 3(c)(1) \n                of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act) (12 U.S.C. \n                1813(c)(1)), including a branch or agency of a foreign \n                bank (as defined in section 1(b)(7) of the \n                International Banking Act of 1978) (12 U.S.C. 3101(7)); \n                (ii) a credit union; (iii) a securities firm, including \n                a broker or dealer; (iv) an insurance company, \n                including an agency or underwriter; and (v) any other \n                company that provides financial services;\n                    (e) the term ``United States financial \n                institution'' means a financial institution (including \n                its foreign branches) organized under the laws of the \n                United States or any jurisdiction within the United \n                States or located in the United States;\n                    (f) the term ``sanctioned person'' means a person \n                on whom the Secretary of State, in accordance with the \n                terms of section 1 of this order, has determined to \n                impose sanctions pursuant to section 1;\n                    (g) the term ``to develop'' petroleum resources \n                means to explore for, or to extract, refine, or \n                transport by pipeline, petroleum resources;\n                    (h) the term ``Iran'' means the Government of Iran \n                and the territory of Iran and any other territory or \n                marine area, including the exclusive economic zone and \n                continental shelf, over which the Government of Iran \n                claims sovereignty, sovereign rights, or jurisdiction, \n                provided that the Government of Iran exercises partial \n                or total de facto control over the area or derives a \n                benefit from economic activity in the area pursuant to \n                international arrangements;\n                    (i) the term ``Government of Iran'' includes the \n                Government of Iran, any political subdivision, agency, \n                or instrumentality thereof, and any person owned or \n                controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, the \n                Government of Iran;\n                    (j) the term ``knowingly,'' with respect to a \n                conduct, a circumstance, or a result, means that the \n                person has actual knowledge, or should have known, of \n                the conduct, the circumstance, or the result;\n                    (k) the term ``petroleum resources'' includes \n                petroleum, oil, natural gas, liquefied natural gas, and \n                refined petroleum products;\n\n[[Page 72612]]\n\n                    (l) the term ``refined petroleum products'' means \n                diesel, gasoline, jet fuel (including naptha-type and \n                kerosene-type jet fuel), and aviation gasoline; and\n                    (m) the term ``petrochemical products'' includes \n                any aromatic, olefin, and synthesis gas, and any of \n                their derivatives, including ethylene, propylene, \n                butadiene, benzene, toluene, xylene, ammonia, methanol, \n                and urea.\n\n                Sec. 6. For those persons whose property and interests \n                in property are blocked pursuant to this order who \n                might have a constitutional presence in the United \n                States, I find that because of the ability to transfer \n                funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to \n                such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to \n                section 3(a)(iv) of this order would render those \n                measures ineffectual.

The Secretary \n                of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions \n                to other officers and agencies of the United States \n                Government consistent with applicable law. All agencies \n                of the United States Government are hereby directed to \n                take all appropriate measures within their authority to \n                carry out the provisions of this order.\n\n                Sec. 8. This order is not intended to, and does not, \n                create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, \n                enforceable at law or in equity by any party against \n                the United States, its departments, agencies, or \n                entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any \n                other person.\n\n                Sec. 9. The measures taken pursuant to this order are \n                in response to actions of the Government of Iran \n                occurring after the conclusion of the 1981 Algiers \n                Accords, and are intended solely as a response to those \n                later actions.\n\n                Sec. 10.

Policy. The impacts of climate change--\n                including an increase in prolonged periods of \n                excessively high temperatures, more heavy downpours, an \n                increase in wildfires, more severe droughts, permafrost \n                thawing, ocean acidification, and sea-level rise--are \n                already affecting communities, natural resources, \n                ecosystems, economies, and public health across the \n                Nation. These impacts are often most significant for \n                communities that already face economic or health-\n                related challenges, and for species and habitats that \n                are already facing other pressures. Managing these \n                risks requires deliberate preparation, close \n                cooperation, and coordinated planning by the Federal \n                Government, as well as by stakeholders, to facilitate \n                Federal, State, local, tribal, private-sector, and \n                nonprofit-sector efforts to improve climate \n                preparedness and resilience; help safeguard our \n                economy, infrastructure, environment, and natural \n                resources; and provide for the continuity of executive \n                department and agency (agency) operations, services, \n                and programs.\n\n                A foundation for coordinated action on climate change \n                preparedness and resilience across the Federal \n                Government was established by Executive Order 13514 of \n                October 5, 2009 (Federal Leadership in Environmental, \n                Energy, and Economic Performance), and the Interagency \n                Climate Change Adaptation Task Force led by the Council \n                on Environmental Quality (CEQ), the Office of Science \n                and Technology Policy (OSTP), and the National Oceanic \n                and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In addition, \n                through the U.S. Global Change Research Program \n                (USGCRP), established by section 103 of the Global \n                Change Research Act of 1990 (15 U.S.C. 2933), and \n                agency programs and activities, the Federal Government \n                will continue to support scientific research, \n                observational capabilities, and assessments necessary \n                to improve our understanding of and response to climate \n                change and its impacts on the Nation.\n\n                The Federal Government must build on recent progress \n                and pursue new strategies to improve the Nation's \n                preparedness and resilience. In doing so, agencies \n                should promote: (1) engaged and strong partnerships and \n                information sharing at all levels of government; (2) \n                risk-informed decisionmaking and the tools to \n                facilitate it; (3) adaptive learning, in which \n                experiences serve as opportunities to inform and adjust \n                future actions; and (4) preparedness planning.\n\n                Sec. 2.

If a shorter \n                period of time is required under the circumstances\n\n[[Page 4670]]\n\n                set forth in section 1270.44 of the NARA regulations, \n                the Archivist shall so indicate in the notice.\n\n                Sec. 3. Claim of Executive Privilege by Incumbent \n                President. (a) Upon receipt of a notice of intent to \n                disclose Presidential records, the Attorney General \n                (directly or through the Assistant Attorney General for \n                the Office of Legal Counsel) and the Counsel to the \n                President shall review as they deem appropriate the \n                records covered by the notice and consult with each \n                other, the Archivist, and such other executive agencies \n                as they deem appropriate concerning whether invocation \n                of executive privilege is justified.\n\n                    (b) The Attorney General and the Counsel to the \n                President, in the exercise of their discretion and \n                after appropriate review and consultation under \n                subsection (a) of this section, may jointly determine \n                that invocation of executive privilege is not \n                justified. The Archivist shall be notified promptly of \n                any such determination.\n                    (c) If either the Attorney General or the Counsel \n                to the President believes that the circumstances \n                justify invocation of executive privilege, the issue \n                shall be presented to the President by the Counsel to \n                the President and the Attorney General.\n                    (d) If the President decides to invoke executive \n                privilege, the Counsel to the President shall notify \n                the former President, the Archivist, and the Attorney \n                General in writing of the claim of privilege and the \n                specific Presidential records to which it relates. \n                After receiving such notice, the Archivist shall not \n                disclose the privileged records unless directed to do \n                so by an incumbent President or by a final court order.\n\n                Sec. 4. Claim of Executive Privilege by Former \n                President. (a) Upon receipt of a claim of executive \n                privilege by a living former President, the Archivist \n                shall consult with the Attorney General (through the \n                Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal \n                Counsel), the Counsel to the President, and such other \n                executive agencies as the Archivist deems appropriate \n                concerning the Archivist's determination as to whether \n                to honor the former President's claim of privilege or \n                instead to disclose the Presidential records \n                notwithstanding the claim of privilege. Any \n                determination under section 3 of this order that \n                executive privilege shall not be invoked by the \n                incumbent President shall not prejudice the Archivist's \n                determination with respect to the former President's \n                claim of privilege.\n\n                    (b) In making the determination referred to in \n                subsection (a) of this section, the Archivist shall \n                abide by any instructions given him by the incumbent \n                President or his designee unless otherwise directed by \n                a final court order. The Archivist shall notify the \n                incumbent and former Presidents of his determination at \n                least 30 days prior to disclosure of the Presidential \n                records, unless a shorter time period is required in \n                the circumstances set forth in section 1270.44 of the \n                NARA regulations. Copies of the notice for the \n                incumbent President shall be delivered to the President \n                (through the Counsel to the President) and the Attorney \n                General (through the Assistant Attorney General for the \n                Office of Legal Counsel).

Policy. This order is designed to promote \n                economy and efficiency in Federal Government \n                procurement. It is the policy of the executive branch \n                to enforce vigorously the civil rights laws of the \n                United States, including those laws that prohibit \n                discriminatory practices with respect to compensation. \n                Federal contractors that employ such practices are \n                subject to enforcement action, increasing the risk of \n                disruption, delay, and increased expense in Federal \n                contracting. Compensation discrimination also can lead \n                to labor disputes that are burdensome and costly.\n\n                When employees are prohibited from inquiring about, \n                disclosing, or discussing their compensation with \n                fellow workers, compensation discrimination is much \n                more difficult to discover and remediate, and more \n                likely to persist. Such prohibitions (either express or \n                tacit) also restrict the amount of information \n                available to participants in the Federal contracting \n                labor pool, which tends to diminish market efficiency \n                and decrease the likelihood that the most qualified and \n                productive workers are hired at the market efficient \n                price. Ensuring that employees of Federal contractors \n                may discuss their compensation without fear of adverse \n                action will enhance the ability of Federal contractors \n                and their employees to detect and remediate unlawful \n                discriminatory practices, which will contribute to a \n                more efficient market in Federal contracting.\n\n                Sec. 2. Amending Executive Order 11246. Section 202 of \n                Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, as \n                amended, is hereby further amended as follows:\n\n                    (a) Paragraphs (3) through (7) are redesignated as \n                paragraphs (4) through (8).\n                    (b) A new paragraph (3) is added to read as \n                follows:\n                    ``The contractor will not discharge or in any other \n                manner discriminate against any employee or applicant \n                for employment because such employee or applicant has \n                inquired about, discussed, or disclosed the \n                compensation of the employee or applicant or another \n                employee or applicant. This provision shall not apply \n                to instances in which an employee who has access to the \n                compensation information of other employees or \n                applicants as a part of such employee's essential job \n                functions discloses the compensation of such other \n                employees or applicants to individuals who do not \n                otherwise have access to such information, unless such \n                disclosure is in response to a formal complaint or \n                charge, in furtherance of an investigation, proceeding, \n                hearing, or action, including an investigation \n                conducted by the employer, or is consistent with the \n                contractor's legal duty to furnish information.''\n\n                Sec. 3.

General Principles of Regulation. (a) Our \n                regulatory system must protect public health, welfare, \n                safety, and our environment while promoting economic \n                growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job creation. \n                It must be based on the best available science. It must \n                allow for public participation and an open exchange of \n                ideas. It must promote predictability and reduce \n                uncertainty. It must identify and use the best, most \n                innovative, and least burdensome tools for achieving \n                regulatory ends. It must take into account benefits and \n                costs, both quantitative and qualitative. It must \n                ensure that regulations are accessible, consistent, \n                written in plain language, and easy to understand. It \n                must measure, and seek to improve, the actual results \n                of regulatory requirements.\n\n                    (b) This order is supplemental to and reaffirms the \n                principles, structures, and definitions governing \n                contemporary regulatory review that were established in \n                Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993. As stated \n                in that Executive Order and to the extent permitted by \n                law, each agency must, among other things: (1) propose \n                or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned \n                determination that its benefits justify its costs \n                (recognizing that some benefits and costs are difficult \n                to quantify); (2) tailor its regulations to impose the \n                least burden on society, consistent with obtaining \n                regulatory objectives, taking into account, among other \n                things, and to the extent practicable, the costs of \n                cumulative regulations; (3) select, in choosing among \n                alternative regulatory approaches, those approaches \n                that maximize net benefits (including potential \n                economic, environmental, public health and safety, and \n                other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity); \n                (4) to the extent feasible, specify performance \n                objectives, rather than specifying the behavior or \n                manner of compliance that regulated entities must \n                adopt; and (5) identify and assess available \n                alternatives to direct regulation, including providing \n                economic incentives to encourage the desired behavior, \n                such as user fees or marketable permits, or providing \n                information upon which choices can be made by the \n                public.\n                    (c) In applying these principles, each agency is \n                directed to use the best available techniques to \n                quantify anticipated present and future benefits and \n                costs as accurately as possible. Where appropriate and \n                permitted by law, each agency may consider (and discuss \n                qualitatively) values that are difficult or impossible \n                to quantify, including equity, human dignity, fairness, \n                and distributive impacts.\n\n                Sec. 2. Public Participation. (a) Regulations shall be \n                adopted through a process that involves public \n                participation. To that end, regulations shall be based, \n                to the extent feasible and consistent with law, on the \n                open exchange of information and perspectives among \n                State, local, and tribal officials, experts in relevant \n                disciplines, affected stakeholders in the private \n                sector, and the public as a whole.\n\n                    (b) To promote that open exchange, each agency, \n                consistent with Executive Order 12866 and other \n                applicable legal requirements, shall endeavor to \n                provide the public with an opportunity to participate \n                in the regulatory process. To the extent feasible and \n                permitted by law, each agency shall afford the public a \n                meaningful opportunity to comment through the Internet \n                on any proposed regulation, with a comment period that \n                should generally\n\n[[Page 3822]]\n\n                be at least 60 days. To the extent feasible and \n                permitted by law, each agency shall also provide, for \n                both proposed and final rules, timely online access to \n                the rulemaking docket on <a href=\"http://regulations.gov\">regulations.gov</a>, including \n                relevant scientific and technical findings, in an open \n                format that can be easily searched and downloaded. For \n                proposed rules, such access shall include, to the \n                extent feasible and permitted by law, an opportunity \n                for public comment on all pertinent parts of the \n                rulemaking docket, including relevant scientific and \n                technical findings.\n                    (c) Before issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking, \n                each agency, where feasible and appropriate, shall seek \n                the views of those who are likely to be affected, \n                including those who are likely to benefit from and \n                those who are potentially subject to such rulemaking.\n\n                Sec. 3. Integration and Innovation. Some sectors and \n                industries face a significant number of regulatory \n                requirements, some of which may be redundant, \n                inconsistent, or overlapping. Greater coordination \n                across agencies could reduce these requirements, thus \n                reducing costs and simplifying and harmonizing rules. \n                In developing regulatory actions and identifying \n                appropriate approaches, each agency shall attempt to \n                promote such coordination, simplification, and \n                harmonization. Each agency shall also seek to identify, \n                as appropriate, means to achieve regulatory goals that \n                are designed to promote innovation.\n\n                Sec. 4. Flexible Approaches. Where relevant, feasible, \n                and consistent with regulatory objectives, and to the \n                extent permitted by law, each agency shall identify and \n                consider regulatory approaches that reduce burdens and \n                maintain flexibility and freedom of choice for the \n                public. These approaches include warnings, appropriate \n                default rules, and disclosure requirements as well as \n                provision of information to the public in a form that \n                is clear and intelligible.\n\n                Sec. 5. Science. Consistent with the President's \n                Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and \n                Agencies, ``Scientific Integrity'' (March 9, 2009), and \n                its implementing guidance, each agency shall ensure the \n                objectivity of any scientific and technological \n                information and processes used to support the agency's \n                regulatory actions.\n\n                Sec. 6. Retrospective Analyses of Existing Rules. (a) \n                To facilitate the periodic review of existing \n                significant regulations, agencies shall consider how \n                best to promote retrospective analysis of rules that \n                may be outmoded, ineffective, insufficient, or \n                excessively burdensome, and to modify, streamline, \n                expand, or repeal them in accordance with what has been \n                learned.

Policy. The information technology \n                revolution has changed the way business is transacted, \n                government operates, and national defense is conducted. \n                Those three functions now depend on an interdependent \n                network of critical information infrastructures.

The implementation of \n                this policy shall include a voluntary public-private \n                partnership, involving corporate and nongovernmental \n                organizations.\n\n                Sec. 2. Continuing Authorities. This order does not \n                alter the existing authorities or roles of United \n                States Government departments and agencies. Authorities \n                set forth in 44 U.S.C. chapter 35, and other applicable \n                law, provide senior officials with responsibility for \n                the security of Federal Government information systems.\n\n                    (a) Executive Branch Information Systems Security. \n                The Director of the Office of Management and Budget \n                (OMB) has the responsibility to develop and oversee the \n                implementation of government-wide policies, principles, \n                standards, and guidelines for the security of \n                information systems that support the executive branch \n                departments and agencies, except those noted in section \n                2(b) of this order. The Director of OMB shall advise \n                the President and the appropriate department or agency \n                head when there is a critical deficiency in the \n                security practices within the purview of this section \n                in an executive branch department or agency.\n                    (b) National Security Information Systems. The \n                Secretary of Defense and the Director of Central \n                Intelligence (DCI) shall have responsibility to \n                oversee, develop, and ensure implementation of \n                policies, principles, standards, and guidelines for the \n                security of information systems that support the \n                operations under their respective control. In \n                consultation with the Assistant to the President for \n                National Security Affairs and the affected departments \n                and agencies, the Secretary of Defense and the DCI \n                shall develop policies, principles, standards, and \n                guidelines for the security of national security \n                information systems that support the operations of \n                other executive branch departments and agencies with \n                national security information.\n\n  (i) Policies, principles, standards, and guidelines developed under this \nsubsection may require more stringent protection than those developed in \naccordance with section 2(a) of this order.\n\n  (ii) The Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs shall \nadvise the President and the appropriate department or agency when there is \na critical deficiency in the security practices of a department or agency \nwithin the purview of this section.\n\n  (iii) National Security Systems. The National Security Telecommunications \nand Information Systems Security Committee, as established by\n\n[[Page 10621]]\n\nand consistent with NSD-42 and chaired by the Department of Defense, shall \nbe designated as the ``Committee on National Security Systems.''\n\n                    (c) Additional Responsibilities. The heads of \n                executive branch departments and agencies are \n                responsible and accountable for providing and \n                maintaining adequate levels of security for information \n                systems, including emergency preparedness \n                communications systems, for programs under their \n                control.

Policy. (a) To maintain our Nation's \n                competitive edge and ensure an economy built to last, \n                the United States must have fast, reliable, resilient, \n                and environmentally sound means of moving people, \n                goods, energy, and information. In a global economy, we \n                will compete for the world's investments based in \n                significant part on the quality of our infrastructure. \n                Investing in the Nation's infrastructure provides \n                immediate and long-term economic benefits for local \n                communities and the Nation as a whole.\n\n                The quality of our Nation's infrastructure depends in \n                critical part on Federal permitting and review \n                processes, including planning, approval, and \n                consultation processes. These processes inform \n                decision-makers and affected communities about the \n                potential benefits and impacts of proposed \n                infrastructure projects, and ensure that projects are \n                designed, built, and maintained in a manner that is \n                consistent with protecting our public health, welfare, \n                safety, national security, and environment. Reviews and \n                approvals of infrastructure projects can be delayed due \n                to many factors beyond the control of the Federal \n                Government, such as poor project design, incomplete \n                applications, uncertain funding, or multiple reviews \n                and approvals by State, local, tribal, or other \n                jurisdictions. Given these factors, it is critical that \n                executive departments and agencies (agencies) take all \n                steps within their authority, consistent with available \n                resources, to execute Federal permitting and review \n                processes with maximum efficiency and effectiveness, \n                ensuring the health, safety, and security of \n                communities and the environment while supporting vital \n                economic growth.\n\n                To achieve that objective, our Federal permitting and \n                review processes must provide a transparent, \n                consistent, and predictable path for both project \n                sponsors and affected communities. They must ensure \n                that agencies set and adhere to timelines and schedules \n                for completion of reviews, set clear permitting \n                performance goals, and track progress against those \n                goals. They must encourage early collaboration among \n                agencies, project sponsors, and affected stakeholders \n                in order to incorporate and address their interests and \n                minimize delays. They must provide for transparency and \n                accountability by utilizing cost-effective information \n                technology to collect and disseminate information about \n                individual projects and agency performance, so that the \n                priorities and concerns of all our citizens are \n                considered. They must rely upon early and active \n                consultation with State, local, and tribal governments \n                to avoid conflicts or duplication of effort, resolve \n                concerns, and allow for concurrent rather than \n                sequential reviews. They must recognize the critical \n                role project sponsors play in assuring the timely and \n                cost-effective review of projects by providing complete \n                information and analysis and by supporting, as \n                appropriate, the costs associated with review. And, \n                they must enable agencies to share priorities, work \n                collaboratively and concurrently to advance reviews and \n                permitting decisions, and facilitate the resolution of \n                disputes at all levels of agency organization.\n\n[[Page 18888]]\n\n                Each of these elements must be incorporated into \n                routine agency practice to provide demonstrable \n                improvements in the performance of Federal \n                infrastructure permitting and review processes, \n                including lower costs, more timely decisions, and a \n                healthier and cleaner environment. Also, these elements \n                must be integrated into project planning processes so \n                that projects are designed appropriately to avoid, to \n                the extent practicable, adverse impacts on public \n                health, security, historic properties and other \n                cultural resources, and the environment, and to \n                minimize or mitigate impacts that may occur. Permitting \n                and review process improvements that have proven \n                effective must be expanded and institutionalized.\n\n                    (b) In advancing this policy, this order expands \n                upon efforts undertaken pursuant to Executive Order \n                13580 of July 12, 2011 (Interagency Working Group on \n                Coordination of Domestic Energy Development and \n                Permitting in Alaska), Executive Order 13563 of January \n                18, 2011 (Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review), \n                and my memorandum of August 31, 2011 (Speeding \n                Infrastructure Development Through More Efficient and \n                Effective Permitting and Environmental Review), as well \n                as other ongoing efforts.\n\n                Sec. 2.

Helping executive departments and \n                agencies (agencies) to identify and work with \n                contractors with track records of compliance will \n                reduce execution delays and avoid distractions and \n                complications that arise from contracting with \n                contractors with track records of noncompliance.\n\n                Sec. 2.

In order \n                to facilitate Government-wide consistency in \n                implementing the requirements of this order:\n\n                    (a) to the extent permitted by law, the FAR Council \n                shall, in consultation with the Department of Labor, \n                the Office of Management and Budget, relevant \n                enforcement agencies, and contracting agencies, propose \n                to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to identify \n                considerations for determining whether serious, \n                repeated, willful, or pervasive violations of the labor \n                laws listed in section 2(a)(i) of this order \n                demonstrate a lack of integrity or business ethics. \n                Such considerations shall apply to the integrity and \n                business ethics determinations made by both contracting \n                officers and contractors pursuant to this order. In \n                addition, such proposed regulations shall:\n\n(i) provide that, subject to the determination of the agency, in most cases \na single violation of law may not necessarily give rise to a determination \nof lack of responsibility, depending on the nature of the violation;\n\n(ii) ensure appropriate consideration is given to any remedial measures or \nmitigating factors, including any agreements by contractors or other \ncorrective action taken to address violations; and\n\n(iii) ensure that contracting officers and Labor Compliance Advisors send \ninformation, as appropriate, to the agency suspending and debarring \nofficial, in accordance with agency procedures.\n\n                    (b) the Secretary of Labor shall:\n\n(i) develop guidance, in consultation with the agencies responsible for \nenforcing the requirements of the labor laws listed in section 2(a)(i) of \nthis order, to assist agencies in determining whether administrative merits \ndeterminations, arbitral awards or decisions, or civil judgments were \nissued for serious, repeated, willful, or pervasive violations of these \nrequirements for purposes of implementation of any final rule issued by the \nFAR Council pursuant to this order. Such guidance shall:\n\n  (A) where available, incorporate existing statutory standards for \nassessing whether a violation is serious, repeated, or willful; and\n\n  (B) where no statutory standards exist, develop standards that take into \naccount:\n\n(1) for determining whether a violation is ``serious'' in nature, the \nnumber of employees affected, the degree of risk posed or actual harm done \nby the violation to the health, safety, or well-being of a worker, the \namount of damages incurred or fines or penalties assessed with\n\n[[Page 45313]]\n\nregard to the violation, and other considerations as the Secretary finds \nappropriate;\n\n(2) for determining whether a violation is ``repeated'' in nature, whether \nthe entity has had one or more additional violations of the same or a \nsubstantially similar requirement in the past 3 years;\n\n(3) for determining whether a violation is ``willful'' in nature, whether \nthe entity knew of, showed reckless disregard for, or acted with plain \nindifference to the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited by the \nrequirements of the labor laws listed in section 2(a)(i) of this order; and\n\n(4) for determining whether a violation is ``pervasive'' in nature, the \nnumber of violations of a requirement or the aggregate number of violations \nof requirements in relation to the size of the entity;\n\n(ii) develop processes:\n\n  (A) for Labor Compliance Advisors to consult with the Department of Labor \nin carrying out their responsibilities under section 3(d) of this order;\n\n  (B) by which contracting officers and Labor Compliance Advisors may give \nappropriate consideration to determinations and agreements made by the \nDepartment of Labor and other agencies; and\n\n  (C) by which contractors may enter into agreements with the Department of \nLabor or other enforcement agency prior to being considered for contracts.\n\n(iii) review data collection requirements and processes, and work with the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget, the Administrator for \nGeneral Services, and other agency heads to improve those processes and \nexisting data collection systems, as necessary, to reduce the burden on \ncontractors and increase the amount of information available to agencies;\n\n(iv) regularly convene interagency meetings of Labor Compliance Advisors to \nshare and promote best practices for improving labor law compliance; and\n\n(v) designate an appropriate contact for agencies seeking to consult with \nthe Department of Labor pursuant to this order;\n\n                    (c) the Director of the Office of Management and \n                Budget shall:\n\n(i) work with the Administrator of General Services to include in the \nFederal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System information \nprovided by contractors pursuant to sections 2(a)(i) and (ii) and 2(b)(i) \nof this order, and data on the resolution of any issues related to such \ninformation; and\n\n(ii) designate an appropriate contact for agencies seeking to consult with \nthe Office of Management and Budget pursuant to this order;\n\n                    (d) the Administrator of General Services, in \n                consultation with other relevant agencies, shall \n                develop a single Web site for Federal contractors to \n                use for all Federal contract reporting requirements \n                related to this order, as well as any other Federal \n                contract reporting requirements to the extent \n                practicable;\n                    (e) in developing the guidance pursuant to \n                subsection (b) of this section and proposing to amend \n                the Federal Acquisition Regulation pursuant to \n                subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of Labor \n                and the FAR Council, respectively, shall minimize, to \n                the extent practicable, the burden of complying with \n                this order for Federal contractors and subcontractors \n                and in particular small entities, including small \n                businesses, as defined in section 3 of the Small \n                Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632), and small nonprofit \n                organizations; and\n                    (f) agencies shall provide the Administrator of \n                General Services with the necessary data to develop the \n                Web site described in subsection (d) of this section.\n\n[[Page 45314]]\n\n                Sec. 5.

Agencies \n                shall also require that contractors incorporate this \n                same requirement into subcontracts covered by section 2 \n                of this order. The document provided to individuals \n                exempt from the overtime compensation requirements of \n                the Fair Labor Standards Act need not include a record \n                of hours worked if the contractor informs the \n                individuals of their overtime exempt status. These \n                requirements shall be deemed to be fulfilled if the \n                contractor is complying with State or local \n                requirements that the Secretary of Labor has determined \n                are substantially similar to those required by this \n                subsection.\n\n                    (b) If the contractor is treating an individual \n                performing work under a contract or subcontract subject \n                to subsection (a) of this section as an independent \n                contractor, and not an employee, the contractor must \n                provide a document informing the individual of this \n                status.\n\n                Sec. 6. Complaint and Dispute Transparency. (a) \n                Agencies shall ensure that for all contracts where the \n                estimated value of the supplies acquired and services \n                required exceeds $1 million, provisions in \n                solicitations and clauses in contracts shall provide \n                that contractors agree that the decision to arbitrate \n                claims arising under title VII of the Civil Rights Act \n                of 1964 or any tort related to or arising out of sexual \n                assault or harassment may only be made with the \n                voluntary consent of employees or independent \n                contractors after such disputes arise. Agencies shall \n                also require that contractors incorporate this same \n                requirement into subcontracts where the estimated value \n                of the supplies acquired and services required exceeds \n                $1 million.\n\n                    (b) Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply \n                to contracts or subcontracts for the acquisition of \n                commercial items or commercially available off-the-\n                shelf items.\n                    (c) A contractor's or subcontractor's agreement \n                under subsection (a) of this section to arbitrate \n                certain claims only with the voluntary post-dispute \n                consent of employees or independent contractors shall \n                not apply with respect to:\n\n(i) employees who are covered by any type of collective bargaining \nagreement negotiated between the contractor and a labor organization \nrepresenting them; or\n\n(ii) employees or independent contractors who entered into a valid contract \nto arbitrate prior to the contractor or subcontractor bidding on a contract \ncovered by this order, except that a contractor's or subcontractor's \nagreement under subsection (a) of this section to arbitrate certain claims \nonly with the voluntary post-dispute consent of employees or independent \ncontractors shall apply if the contractor or subcontractor is permitted to \nchange the terms of the contract with the employee or independent \ncontractor, or when the contract is renegotiated or replaced.\n\n                Sec. 7. Implementing Regulations. In addition to \n                proposing to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation \n                as required by section 4(a) of this order, the FAR \n                Council shall propose such rules and regulations and \n                issue such orders as are deemed necessary and \n                appropriate to carry out this order, including sections \n                5 and 6, and shall issue final regulations in a timely \n                fashion after considering all public comments, as \n                appropriate.\n\n                Sec. 8.

Policy. (a) Large-scale construction \n                projects pose special challenges to efficient and \n                timely procurement by the Federal Government. \n                Construction employers typically do not have a \n                permanent workforce, which makes it difficult for them \n                to predict labor costs when bidding on contracts and to \n                ensure a steady supply of labor on contracts being \n                performed. Challenges also arise due to the fact that \n                construction projects typically involve multiple \n                employers at a single location. A labor dispute \n                involving one employer can delay the entire project. A \n                lack of coordination among various employers, or \n                uncertainty about the terms and conditions of \n                employment of various groups of workers, can create \n                frictions and disputes in the absence of an agreed-upon \n                resolution mechanism. These problems threaten the \n                efficient and timely completion of construction \n                projects undertaken by Federal contractors. On larger \n                projects, which are generally more complex and of \n                longer duration, these problems tend to be more \n                pronounced.\n\n                    (b) The use of a project labor agreement may \n                prevent these problems from developing by providing \n                structure and stability to large-scale construction \n                projects, thereby promoting the efficient and \n                expeditious completion of Federal construction \n                contracts. Accordingly, it is the policy of the Federal \n                Government to encourage executive agencies to consider \n                requiring the use of project labor agreements in \n                connection with large-scale construction projects in \n                order to promote economy and efficiency in Federal \n                procurement.\n\n                Sec. 2. Definitions.\n\n                    (a) The term ``labor organization'' as used in this \n                order means a labor organization as defined in 29 \n                U.S.C. 152(5).\n                    (b) The term ``construction'' as used in this order \n                means construction, rehabilitation, alteration, \n                conversion, extension, repair, or improvement of \n                buildings, highways, or other real property.\n                    (c) The term ``large-scale construction project'' \n                as used in this order means a construction project \n                where the total cost to the Federal Government is $25 \n                million or more.\n                    (d) The term ``executive agency'' as used in this \n                order has the same meaning as in 5 U.S.C. 105, but \n                excludes the Government Accountability Office.\n                    (e) The term ``project labor agreement'' as used in \n                this order means a pre-hire collective bargaining \n                agreement with one or more labor organizations that \n                establishes the terms and conditions of employment for \n                a specific construction project and is an agreement \n                described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).\n\n                Sec. 3. (a) In awarding any contract in connection with \n                a large-scale construction project, or obligating funds \n                pursuant to such a contract, executive agencies may, on \n                a project-by-project basis, require the use of a \n                project labor agreement by a contractor where use of \n                such an agreement will (i)\n\n[[Page 6986]]\n\n                advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving \n                economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, \n                producing labor-management stability, and ensuring \n                compliance with laws and regulations governing safety \n                and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and \n                employment standards, and other matters, and (ii) be \n                consistent with law.\n\n                    (b) If an executive agency determines under \n                subsection (a) that the use of a project labor \n                agreement will satisfy the criteria in clauses (i) and \n                (ii) of that subsection, the agency may, if \n                appropriate, require that every contractor or \n                subcontractor on the project agree, for that project, \n                to negotiate or become a party to a project labor \n                agreement with one or more appropriate labor \n                organizations.\n\n                Sec. 4. Any project labor agreement reached pursuant to \n                this order shall:\n\n                    (a) bind all contractors and subcontractors on the \n                Construction project through the inclusion of \n                appropriate specifications in all relevant solicitation \n                provisions and contract documents;\n                    (b) allow all contractors and subcontractors to \n                compete for contracts and subcontracts without regard \n                to whether they are otherwise parties to collective \n                bargaining agreements;\n                    (c) contain guarantees against strikes, lockouts, \n                and similar job disruptions;\n                    (d) set forth effective, prompt, and mutually \n                binding procedures for resolving labor disputes arising \n                during the project labor agreement;\n                    (e) provide other mechanisms for labor-management \n                cooperation on matters of mutual interest and concern, \n                including productivity, quality of work, safety, and \n                health;and\n                    (f) fully conform to all statutes, regulations, and \n                Executive Orders.\n\n                Sec. 5. This order does not require an executive agency \n                to use a project labor agreement on any construction \n                project, nor does it preclude the use of a project \n                labor agreement in circumstances not covered by this \n                order, including leasehold arrangements and projects \n                receiving Federal financial assistance. This order also \n                does not require contractors or subcontractors to enter \n                into a project labor agreement with any particular \n                labor organization.\n\n                Sec. 6. Within 120 days of the date of this order, the \n                Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council), \n                to the extent permitted by law, shall take whatever \n                action is required to amend the Federal Acquisition \n                Regulation to implement the provisions of this order.\n\n                Sec. 7. The Director of OMB, in consultation with the \n                Secretary of Labor and with other officials as \n                appropriate, shall provide the President within 180 \n                days of this order, recommendations about whether \n                broader use of project labor agreements, with respect \n                to both construction projects undertaken under Federal \n                contracts and construction projects receiving Federal \n                financial assistance, would help to promote the \n                economical, efficient, and timely completion of such \n                projects.\n\n                Sec. 8. Revocation of Prior Orders, Rules, and \n                Regulations. Executive Order 13202 of February 17, \n                2001, and Executive Order 13208 of April 6, 2001, are \n                revoked.

Severability. If any provision of this order, \n                or the application of such provision to any person or \n                circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of \n                this order and the application of the provisions of \n                such to any person or circumstance shall not be \n                affected thereby.\n\n                Sec. 10. General. (a) Nothing in this order shall be \n                construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n  (i) authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the \nhead thereof; or\n\n  (ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget \nrelating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n[[Page 6987]]\n\n                    (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with \n                applicable law and subject to the availability of \n                appropriations.\n                    (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, \n                create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, \n                enforceable at law or in equity by any party against \n                the United States, its departments, agencies, or \n                entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any \n                other person.\n\n                Sec. 11.

Policy. The discovery of antibiotics in the \n                early 20th century fundamentally transformed human and \n                veterinary medicine. Antibiotics save millions of lives \n                each year in the United States and around the world. \n                The rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, however, \n                represents a serious threat to public health and the \n                economy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n                (CDC) in the Department of Health and Human Services \n                (HHS) estimates that annually at least two million \n                illnesses and 23,000 deaths are caused by antibiotic-\n                resistant bacteria in the United States alone.\n\n                Detecting, preventing, and controlling antibiotic \n                resistance requires a strategic, coordinated, and \n                sustained effort. It also depends on the engagement of \n                governments, academia, industry, healthcare providers, \n                the general public, and the agricultural community, as \n                well as international partners. Success in this effort \n                will require significant efforts to: minimize the \n                emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria; preserve \n                the efficacy of new and existing antibacterial drugs; \n                advance research to develop improved methods for \n                combating antibiotic resistance and conducting \n                antibiotic stewardship; strengthen surveillance efforts \n                in public health and agriculture; develop and promote \n                the use of new, rapid diagnostic technologies; \n                accelerate scientific research and facilitate the \n                development of new antibacterial drugs, vaccines, \n                diagnostics, and other novel therapeutics; maximize the \n                dissemination of the most up-to-date information on the \n                appropriate and proper use of antibiotics to the \n                general public and healthcare providers; work with the \n                pharmaceutical industry to include information on the \n                proper use of over-the-counter and prescription \n                antibiotic medications for humans and animals; and \n                improve international collaboration and capabilities \n                for prevention, surveillance, stewardship, basic \n                research, and drug and diagnostics development.\n\n                The Federal Government will work domestically and \n                internationally to detect, prevent, and control illness \n                and death related to antibiotic-resistant infections by \n                implementing measures that reduce the emergence and \n                spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and help ensure \n                the continued availability of effective therapeutics \n                for the treatment of bacterial infections.\n\n                Sec. 2. Oversight and Coordination. Combating \n                antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a national security \n                priority.

Policy. In 2011, natural gas provided 25 \n                percent of the energy consumed in the United States. \n                Its production creates jobs and provides economic \n                benefits to the entire domestic production supply \n                chain, as well as to chemical and other manufacturers, \n                who benefit from lower feedstock and energy costs. By \n                helping to power our transportation system, greater use \n                of natural gas can also reduce our dependence on oil. \n                And with appropriate safeguards, natural gas can \n                provide a cleaner source of energy than other fossil \n                fuels.\n\n                For these reasons, it is vital that we take full \n                advantage of our natural gas resources, while giving \n                American families and communities confidence that \n                natural and cultural resources, air and water quality, \n                and public health and safety will not be compromised.\n\n                While natural gas production is carried out by private \n                firms, and States are the primary regulators of onshore \n                oil and gas activities, the Federal Government has an \n                important role to play by regulating oil and gas \n                activities on public and Indian trust lands, \n                encouraging greater use of natural gas in \n                transportation, supporting research and development \n                aimed at improving the safety of natural gas \n                development and transportation activities, and setting \n                sensible, cost-effective public health and \n                environmental standards to implement Federal law and \n                augment State safeguards.\n\n                Because efforts to promote safe, responsible, and \n                efficient development of unconventional domestic \n                natural gas resources are underway at a number of \n                executive departments and agencies (agencies), close \n                interagency coordination is important for effective \n                implementation of these programs and activities. To \n                formalize and promote ongoing interagency coordination, \n                this order establishes a high-level, interagency \n                working group that will facilitate coordinated \n                Administration policy efforts to support safe and \n                responsible unconventional domestic natural gas \n                development.\n\n                Sec. 2. Interagency Working Group to Support Safe and \n                Responsible Development of Unconventional Domestic \n                Natural Gas Resources. There is established an \n                Interagency Working Group to Support Safe and \n                Responsible Development of Unconventional Domestic \n                Natural Gas Resources (Working Group), to be chaired by \n                the Director of the Domestic Policy Council, or a \n                designated representative.\n\n                    (a) Membership. In addition to the Chair, the \n                Working Group shall include deputy-level \n                representatives or equivalent officials, designated by \n                the head of the respective agency or office, from:\n\n(i) the Department of Defense;\n\n(ii) the Department of the Interior;\n\n(iii) the Department of Agriculture;\n\n[[Page 23108]]\n\n(iv) the Department of Commerce;\n\n(v) the Department of Health and Human Services;\n\n(vi) the Department of Transportation;\n\n(vii) the Department of Energy;\n\n(viii) the Department of Homeland Security;\n\n(ix) the Environmental Protection Agency;\n\n(x) the Council on Environmental Quality;\n\n(xi) the Office of Science and Technology Policy;\n\n(xii) the Office of Management and Budget;\n\n(xiii) the National Economic Council; and\n\n(xiv) such other agencies or offices as the Chair may invite to \nparticipate.\n\n                    (b) Functions. Consistent with the authorities and \n                responsibilities of participating agencies and offices, \n                the Working Group shall support the safe and \n                responsible production of domestic unconventional \n                natural gas by performing the following functions:\n\n(i) coordinate agency policy activities, ensuring their efficient and \neffective operation and facilitating cooperation among agencies, as \nappropriate;\n\n(ii) coordinate among agencies the sharing of scientific, environmental, \nand related technical and economic information;\n\n(iii) engage in long-term planning and ensure coordination among the \nappropriate Federal entities with respect to such issues as research, \nnatural resource assessment, and the development of infrastructure;\n\n(iv) promote interagency communication with stakeholders; and\n\n(v) consult with other agencies and offices as appropriate.\n\n                Sec. 3.

These communities supply our food, fiber, and \n                energy, safeguard our natural resources, and are \n                essential in the development of science and innovation. \n                Though rural communities face numerous challenges, they \n                also present enormous economic potential. The Federal \n                Government has an important role to play in order to \n                expand access to the capital necessary for economic \n                growth, promote innovation, improve access to health \n                care and education, and expand outdoor recreational \n                activities on public lands.\n\n                To enhance the Federal Government's efforts to address \n                the needs of rural America, this order establishes a \n                council to better coordinate Federal programs and \n                maximize the impact of Federal investment to promote \n                economic prosperity and quality of life in our rural \n                communities.\n\n                Sec. 2.

Policy. Over the last decade, the United \n                States has experienced a decline in employment in the \n                automotive industry and among part suppliers. This \n                decline accelerated dramatically from 2008 to 2009, \n                with more than 400,000 jobs being lost in the industry. \n                Now, 2 years later, the American automotive industry is \n                beginning to recover. The automotive industry has, over \n                the past 2 years, experienced its strongest period of \n                job growth since the late 1990s. Exports have expanded, \n                and the domestic automakers in 2010 gained market share \n                for the first time since 1995. The automotive supply \n                chain, which employs three times as many workers as the \n                automakers, has also shown renewed strength. However, \n                we still have a long way to go.\n\n                Over the past 2 years my Administration has undertaken \n                coordinated efforts on behalf of automotive \n                communities, including targeted technical and financial \n                assistance. For example, the Department of Labor set \n                aside funds for green jobs and job training for high-\n                growth sectors of the economy specifically targeted to \n                communities affected by the automotive downturn, and \n                the Department of Commerce provided funds specifically \n                for automotive communities to develop plans for \n                economic recovery. Stabilizing the automotive industry \n                will also require the use of expanded strategies by \n                automotive communities that include land-use \n                redevelopment, small business support, and worker \n                training.\n\n                The purpose of this order is to continue the \n                coordinated Federal response to factors affecting \n                automotive communities and workers and to ensure that \n                Federal programs and policies address these concerns.\n\n                Sec. 2. Assignment of Responsibilities to the Secretary \n                of Labor.\n\n                    (a) The Secretary of Labor shall:\n\n(i) work to coordinate the development of policies and programs among \nexecutive departments and agencies with the goal of coordinating a Federal \nresponse to factors that have a distinct impact on automotive communities \nand workers, including through the coordination of economic adjustment \nassistance activities;\n\n(ii) advise the President, in coordination with the Director of the \nNational Economic Council, on the potential effects of pending legislation;\n\n(iii) provide recommendations to the President, in coordination with the \nDirector of the National Economic Council, on executive branch policy \nproposals affecting automotive communities and changes to Federal policies \nand programs intended to address issues of special importance to automotive \ncommunities and workers; and\n\n(iv) conduct outreach to representatives of nonprofit organizations, \nbusinesses, labor organizations, State and local government agencies, \nelected officials, and other interested persons that will assist in \nbringing to the President's attention concerns, ideas, and policy options \nfor expanding and improving efforts to revitalize automotive communities.\n\n                    (b) The Secretary of Labor shall perform the \n                functions assigned by this order in coordination with \n                the Director of the National Economic Council.\n\n[[Page 40592]]\n\n                 The Secretary of Labor may delegate these \n                responsibilities to the Executive Director of the \n                Department of Labor Office of Recovery for Auto \n                Communities and Workers.\n\n                Sec. 3.

Policy. Regulations play an indispensable \n                role in protecting public health, welfare, safety, and \n                our environment, but they can also impose significant \n                burdens and costs. During challenging economic times, \n                we should be especially careful not to impose \n                unjustified regulatory requirements. For this reason, \n                it is particularly important for agencies to conduct \n                retrospective analyses of existing rules to examine \n                whether they remain justified and whether they should \n                be modified or streamlined in light of changed \n                circumstances, including the rise of new technologies.\n\n                Executive Order 13563 of January 18, 2011 (Improving \n                Regulation and Regulatory Review), states that our \n                regulatory system ``must measure, and seek to improve, \n                the actual results of regulatory requirements.'' To \n                promote this goal, that Executive Order requires \n                agencies not merely to conduct a single exercise, but \n                to engage in ``periodic review of existing significant \n                regulations.'' Pursuant to section 6(b) of that \n                Executive Order, agencies are required to develop \n                retrospective review plans to review existing \n                significant regulations in order to ``determine whether \n                any such regulations should be modified, streamlined, \n                expanded, or repealed.'' The purpose of this \n                requirement is to ``make the agency's regulatory \n                program more effective or less burdensome in achieving \n                the regulatory objectives.''\n\n                In response to Executive Order 13563, agencies have \n                developed and made available for public comment \n                retrospective review plans that identify over five \n                hundred initiatives. A small fraction of those \n                initiatives, already finalized or formally proposed to \n                the public, are anticipated to eliminate billions of \n                dollars in regulatory costs and tens of millions of \n                hours in annual paperwork burdens. Significantly larger \n                savings are anticipated as the plans are implemented \n                and as action is taken on additional initiatives.\n\n                As a matter of longstanding practice and to satisfy \n                statutory obligations, many agencies engaged in \n                periodic review of existing regulations prior to the \n                issuance of Executive Order 13563. But further steps \n                should be taken, consistent with law, agency resources, \n                and regulatory priorities, to promote public \n                participation in retrospective review, to modernize our \n                regulatory system, and to institutionalize regular \n                assessment of significant regulations.\n\n                Sec. 2. Public Participation in Retrospective Review. \n                Members of the public, including those directly and \n                indirectly affected by regulations, as well as State, \n                local, and tribal governments, have important \n                information about the actual effects of existing \n                regulations. For this reason, and consistent with \n                Executive Order 13563, agencies shall invite, on a \n                regular basis (to be determined by the agency head in \n                consultation with the Office of Information and \n                Regulatory Affairs (OIRA)), public suggestions about \n                regulations in need of retrospective review and about \n                appropriate modifications to such regulations. To \n                promote an open exchange of information, retrospective \n                analyses of regulations, including supporting data, \n                shall be released to the public online wherever \n                practicable.\n\n                Sec. 3. Setting Priorities. In implementing and \n                improving their retrospective review plans, and in \n                considering retrospective review suggestions from the\n\n[[Page 28470]]\n\n                public, agencies shall give priority, consistent with \n                law, to those initiatives that will produce significant \n                quantifiable monetary savings or significant \n                quantifiable reductions in paperwork burdens while \n                protecting public health, welfare, safety, and our \n                environment. To the extent practicable and permitted by \n                law, agencies shall also give special consideration to \n                initiatives that would reduce unjustified regulatory \n                burdens or simplify or harmonize regulatory \n                requirements imposed on small businesses. Consistent \n                with Executive Order 13563 and Executive Order 12866 of \n                September 30, 1993 (Regulatory Planning and Review), \n                agencies shall give consideration to the cumulative \n                effects of their own regulations, including cumulative \n                burdens, and shall to the extent practicable and \n                consistent with law give priority to reforms that would \n                make significant progress in reducing those burdens \n                while protecting public health, welfare, safety, and \n                our environment.\n\n                Sec. 4. Accountability. Agencies shall regularly report \n                on the status of their retrospective review efforts to \n                OIRA. Agency reports should describe progress, \n                anticipated accomplishments, and proposed timelines for \n                relevant actions, with an emphasis on the priorities \n                described in section 3 of this order. Agencies shall \n                submit draft reports to OIRA on September 10, 2012, and \n                on the second Monday of January and July for each year \n                thereafter, unless directed otherwise through \n                subsequent guidance from OIRA. Agencies shall make \n                final reports available to the public within a \n                reasonable period (not to exceed three weeks from the \n                date of submission of draft reports to OIRA).\n\n                Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) For purposes of this \n                order, ``agency'' means any authority of the United \n                States that is an ``agency'' under 44 U.S.C. 3502(1), \n                other than those considered to be independent \n                regulatory agencies, as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(5).\n\n                    (b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to \n                impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i) the authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the head \nthereof; or\n\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget \nrelating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n                    (c) This order shall be implemented consistent with \n                applicable law and subject to the availability of \n                appropriations.\n                    (d) This order is not intended to, and does not, \n                create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, \n                enforceable at law or in equity by any party against \n                the United States, its departments, agencies, or \n                entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any \n                other person.\n                &lt;GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT&gt;\n                \n                    (Presidential Sig.)\n\n                THE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n                    May 10, 2012.\n\n[FR Doc. 2012-11798\nFiled 5-11-12; 11:15 am]\nBilling code 3295-F2-P\n\n\n</pre>]","url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2012/05/14/2012-11798/identifying-and-reducing-regulatory-burdens","president":"obama","id":"13610"},"reftime":1418257683084}

Our democratic \n                principles require that the American people be informed \n                of the activities of their Government. Also, our \n                Nation's progress depends on the free flow of \n                information both within the Government and to the \n                American people. Nevertheless, throughout our history, \n                the national defense has required that certain \n                information be maintained in confidence in order to \n                protect our citizens, our democratic institutions, our \n                homeland security, and our interactions with foreign \n                nations. Protecting information critical to our \n                Nation's security and demonstrating our commitment to \n                open Government through accurate and accountable \n                application of classification standards and routine, \n                secure, and effective declassification are equally \n                important priorities.\n\n                NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, by the authority \n                vested in me as President by the Constitution and the \n                laws of the United States of America, it is hereby \n                ordered as follows:\n\n                PART 1--ORIGINAL CLASSIFICATION\n\n                Section 1.1. Classification Standards. (a) Information \n                may be originally classified under the terms of this \n                order only if all of the following conditions are met:\n\n(1) an original classification authority is classifying the information;\n\n(2) the information is owned by, produced by or for, or is under the \ncontrol of the United States Government;\n\n(3) the information falls within one or more of the categories of \ninformation listed in section 1.4 of this order; and\n\n(4) the original classification authority determines that the unauthorized \ndisclosure of the information reasonably could be expected to result in \ndamage to the national security, which includes defense against \ntransnational terrorism, and the original classification authority is able \nto identify or describe the damage.\n\n                    (b) If there is significant doubt about the need to \n                classify information, it shall not be classified. This \n                provision does not:\n\n(1) amplify or modify the substantive criteria or procedures for \nclassification; or\n\n(2) create any substantive or procedural rights subject to judicial review.\n\n                    (c) Classified information shall not be \n                declassified automatically as a result of any \n                unauthorized disclosure of identical or similar \n                information.\n                    (d) The unauthorized disclosure of foreign \n                government information is presumed to cause damage to \n                the national security.\n\n                Sec. 1.2. Classification Levels. (a) Information may be \n                classified at one of the following three levels:\n\n(1) ``Top Secret'' shall be applied to information, the unauthorized \ndisclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally \ngrave damage to the national security that the original classification \nauthority is able to identify or describe.\n\n(2) ``Secret'' shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure \nof which reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the\n\n[[Page 708]]\n\nnational security that the original classification authority is able to \nidentify or describe.\n\n(3) ``Confidential'' shall be applied to information, the unauthorized \ndisclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the \nnational security that the original classification authority is able to \nidentify or describe.\n\n                    (b) Except as otherwise provided by statute, no \n                other terms shall be used to identify United States \n                classified information.\n                    (c) If there is significant doubt about the \n                appropriate level of classification, it shall be \n                classified at the lower level.\n\n                Sec. 1.3. Classification Authority. (a) The authority \n                to classify information originally may be exercised \n                only by:\n\n(1) the President and the Vice President;\n\n(2) agency heads and officials designated by the President; and\n\n(3) United States Government officials delegated this authority pursuant to \nparagraph (c) of this section.\n\n                    (b) Officials authorized to classify information at \n                a specified level are also authorized to classify \n                information at a lower level.\n                    (c) Delegation of original classification \n                authority.\n\n(1) Delegations of original classification authority shall be limited to \nthe minimum required to administer this order. Agency heads are responsible \nfor ensuring that designated subordinate officials have a demonstrable and \ncontinuing need to exercise this authority.\n\n(2) ``Top Secret'' original classification authority may be delegated only \nby the President, the Vice President, or an agency head or official \ndesignated pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.\n\n(3) ``Secret'' or ``Confidential'' original classification authority may be \ndelegated only by the President, the Vice President, an agency head or \nofficial designated pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or the \nsenior agency official designated under section 5.4(d) of this order, \nprovided that official has been delegated ``Top Secret'' original \nclassification authority by the agency head.\n\n(4) Each delegation of original classification authority shall be in \nwriting and the authority shall not be redelegated except as provided in \nthis order. Each delegation shall identify the official by name or \nposition.\n\n(5) Delegations of original classification authority shall be reported or \nmade available by name or position to the Director of the Information \nSecurity Oversight Office.\n\n                    (d) All original classification authorities must \n                receive training in proper classification (including \n                the avoidance of over-classification) and \n                declassification as provided in this order and its \n                implementing directives at least once a calendar year. \n                Such training must include instruction on the proper \n                safeguarding of classified information and on the \n                sanctions in section 5.5 of this order that may be \n                brought against an individual who fails to classify \n                information properly or protect classified information \n                from unauthorized disclosure. Original classification \n                authorities who do not receive such mandatory training \n                at least once within a calendar year shall have their \n                classification authority suspended by the agency head \n                or the senior agency official designated under section \n                5.4(d) of this order until such training has taken \n                place. A waiver may be granted by the agency head, the \n                deputy agency head, or the senior agency official if an \n                individual is unable to receive such training due to \n                unavoidable circumstances. Whenever a waiver is \n                granted, the individual shall receive such training as \n                soon as practicable.\n                    (e) Exceptional cases. When an employee, government \n                contractor, licensee, certificate holder, or grantee of \n                an agency who does not have original classification \n                authority originates information believed by that \n                person to require classification, the information shall \n                be protected in a manner consistent\n\n[[Page 709]]\n\n                with this order and its implementing directives. The \n                information shall be transmitted promptly as provided \n                under this order or its implementing directives to the \n                agency that has appropriate subject matter interest and \n                classification authority with respect to this \n                information. That agency shall decide within 30 days \n                whether to classify this information.\n\n                Sec. 1.4. Classification Categories. Information shall \n                not be considered for classification unless its \n                unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to \n                cause identifiable or describable damage to the \n                national security in accordance with section 1.2 of \n                this order, and it pertains to one or more of the \n                following:\n\n                    (a) military plans, weapons systems, or operations;\n                    (b) foreign government information;\n                    (c) intelligence activities (including covert \n                action), intelligence sources or methods, or \n                cryptology;\n                    (d) foreign relations or foreign activities of the \n                United States, including confidential sources;\n                    (e) scientific, technological, or economic matters \n                relating to the national security;\n                    (f) United States Government programs for \n                safeguarding nuclear materials or facilities;\n                    (g) vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, \n                installations, infrastructures, projects, plans, or \n                protection services relating to the national security; \n                or (h) the development, production, or use of weapons \n                of mass destruction.\n\n                Sec. 1.5. Duration of Classification. (a) At the time \n                of original classification, the original classification \n                authority shall establish a specific date or event for \n                declassification based on the duration of the national \n                security sensitivity of the information. Upon reaching \n                the date or event, the information shall be \n                automatically declassified. Except for information that \n                should clearly and demonstrably be expected to reveal \n                the identity of a confidential human source or a human \n                intelligence source or key design concepts of weapons \n                of mass destruction, the date or event shall not exceed \n                the time frame established in paragraph (b) of this \n                section.\n\n                    (b) If the original classification authority cannot \n                determine an earlier specific date or event for \n                declassification, information shall be marked for \n                declassification 10 years from the date of the original \n                decision, unless the original classification authority \n                otherwise determines that the sensitivity of the \n                information requires that it be marked for \n                declassification for up to 25 years from the date of \n                the original decision.\n                    (c) An original classification authority may extend \n                the duration of classification up to 25 years from the \n                date of origin of the document, change the level of \n                classification, or reclassify specific information only \n                when the standards and procedures for classifying \n                information under this order are followed.\n                    (d) No information may remain classified \n                indefinitely. Information marked for an indefinite \n                duration of classification under predecessor orders, \n                for example, marked as ``Originating Agency's \n                Determination Required,'' or classified information \n                that contains incomplete declassification instructions \n                or lacks declassification instructions shall be \n                declassified in accordance with part 3 of this order.\n\n                Sec. 1.6. Identification and Markings. (a) At the time \n                of original classification, the following shall be \n                indicated in a manner that is immediately apparent:\n\n(1) one of the three classification levels defined in section 1.2 of this \norder;\n\n(2) the identity, by name and position, or by personal identifier, of the \noriginal classification authority;\n\n(3) the agency and office of origin, if not otherwise evident;\n\n(4) declassification instructions, which shall indicate one of the \nfollowing:\n\n[[Page 710]]\n\n  (A) the date or event for declassification, as prescribed in section \n1.5(a);\n\n  (B) the date that is 10 years from the date of original classification, \nas prescribed in section 1.5(b);\n\n  (C) the date that is up to 25 years from the date of original \nclassification, as prescribed in section 1.5(b); or\n\n  (D) in the case of information that should clearly and demonstrably be \nexpected to reveal the identity of a confidential human source or a human \nintelligence source or key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction, \nthe marking prescribed in implementing directives issued pursuant to this \norder; and\n\n(5) a concise reason for classification that, at a minimum, cites the \napplicable classification categories in section 1.4 of this order.\n\n                    (b) Specific information required in paragraph (a) \n                of this section may be excluded if it would reveal \n                additional classified information.\n                    (c) With respect to each classified document, the \n                agency originating the document shall, by marking or \n                other means, indicate which portions are classified, \n                with the applicable classification level, and which \n                portions are unclassified. In accordance with standards \n                prescribed in directives issued under this order, the \n                Director of the Information Security Oversight Office \n                may grant and revoke temporary waivers of this \n                requirement. The Director shall revoke any waiver upon \n                a finding of abuse.\n                    (d) Markings or other indicia implementing the \n                provisions of this order, including abbreviations and \n                requirements to safeguard classified working papers, \n                shall conform to the standards prescribed in \n                implementing directives issued pursuant to this order.\n                    (e) Foreign government information shall retain its \n                original classification markings or shall be assigned a \n                U.S. classification that provides a degree of \n                protection at least equivalent to that required by the \n                entity that furnished the information. Foreign \n                government information retaining its original \n                classification markings need not be assigned a U.S. \n                classification marking provided that the responsible \n                agency determines that the foreign government markings \n                are adequate to meet the purposes served by U.S. \n                classification markings.\n                    (f) Information assigned a level of classification \n                under this or predecessor orders shall be considered as \n                classified at that level of classification despite the \n                omission of other required markings. Whenever such \n                information is used in the derivative classification \n                process or is reviewed for possible declassification, \n                holders of such information shall coordinate with an \n                appropriate classification authority for the \n                application of omitted markings.\n                    (g) The classification authority shall, whenever \n                practicable, use a classified addendum whenever \n                classified information constitutes a small portion of \n                an otherwise unclassified document or prepare a product \n                to allow for dissemination at the lowest level of \n                classification possible or in unclassified form.\n                    (h) Prior to public release, all declassified \n                records shall be appropriately marked to reflect their \n                declassification.\n\n                Sec. 1.7. Classification Prohibitions and Limitations. \n                (a) In no case shall information be classified, \n                continue to be maintained as classified, or fail to be \n                declassified in order to:\n\n(1) conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error;\n\n(2) prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency;\n\n(3) restrain competition; or\n\n(4) prevent or delay the release of information that does not require \nprotection in the interest of the national security.\n\n                    (b) Basic scientific research information not \n                clearly related to the national security shall not be \n                classified.\n                    (c) Information may not be reclassified after \n                declassification and release to the public under proper \n                authority unless:\n\n[[Page 711]]\n\n(1) the reclassification is personally approved in writing by the agency \nhead based on a document-by-document determination by the agency that \nreclassification is required to prevent significant and demonstrable damage \nto the national security;\n\n(2) the information may be reasonably recovered without bringing undue \nattention to the information;\n\n(3) the reclassification action is reported promptly to the Assistant to \nthe President for National Security Affairs (National Security Advisor) and \nthe Director of the Information Security Oversight Office; and\n\n(4) for documents in the physical and legal custody of the National \nArchives and Records Administration (National Archives) that have been \navailable for public use, the agency head has, after making the \ndeterminations required by this paragraph, notified the Archivist of the \nUnited States (Archivist), who shall suspend public access pending approval \nof the reclassification action by the Director of the Information Security \nOversight Office. Any such decision by the Director may be appealed by the \nagency head to the President through the National Security Advisor. Public \naccess shall remain suspended pending a prompt decision on the appeal.\n\n                    (d) Information that has not previously been \n                disclosed to the public under proper authority may be \n                classified or reclassified after an agency has received \n                a request for it under the Freedom of Information Act \n                (5 U.S.C. 552), the Presidential Records Act, 44 U.S.C. \n                2204(c)(1), the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or \n                the mandatory review provisions of section 3.5 of this \n                order only if such classification meets the \n                requirements of this order and is accomplished on a \n                document-by-document basis with the personal \n                participation or under the direction of the agency \n                head, the deputy agency head, or the senior agency \n                official designated under section 5.4 of this order. \n                The requirements in this paragraph also apply to those \n                situations in which information has been declassified \n                in accordance with a specific date or event determined \n                by an original classification authority in accordance \n                with section 1.5 of this order.\n                    (e) Compilations of items of information that are \n                individually unclassified may be classified if the \n                compiled information reveals an additional association \n                or relationship that:\n\n(1) meets the standards for classification under this order; and\n\n(2) is not otherwise revealed in the individual items of information.\n\n                Sec. 1.8. Classification Challenges. (a) Authorized \n                holders of information who, in good faith, believe that \n                its classification status is improper are encouraged \n                and expected to challenge the classification status of \n                the information in accordance with agency procedures \n                established under paragraph (b) of this section.\n\n                    (b) In accordance with implementing directives \n                issued pursuant to this order, an agency head or senior \n                agency official shall establish procedures under which \n                authorized holders of information, including authorized \n                holders outside the classifying agency, are encouraged \n                and expected to challenge the classification of \n                information that they believe is improperly classified \n                or unclassified. These procedures shall ensure that:\n\n(1) individuals are not subject to retribution for bringing such actions;\n\n(2) an opportunity is provided for review by an impartial official or \npanel; and\n\n(3) individuals are advised of their right to appeal agency decisions to \nthe Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel (Panel) established \nby section 5.3 of this order.\n\n                    (c) Documents required to be submitted for \n                prepublication review or other administrative process \n                pursuant to an approved nondisclosure agreement are not \n                covered by this section.\n\n[[Page 712]]\n\n                Sec. 1.9. Fundamental Classification Guidance Review. \n                (a) Agency heads shall complete on a periodic basis a \n                comprehensive review of the agency's classification \n                guidance, particularly classification guides, to ensure \n                the guidance reflects current circumstances and to \n                identify classified information that no longer requires \n                protection and can be declassified. The initial \n                fundamental classification guidance review shall be \n                completed within 2 years of the effective date of this \n                order.\n\n                    (b) The classification guidance review shall \n                include an evaluation of classified information to \n                determine if it meets the standards for classification \n                under section 1.4 of this order, taking into account an \n                up-to-date assessment of likely damage as described \n                under section 1.2 of this order.\n                    (c) The classification guidance review shall \n                include original classification authorities and agency \n                subject matter experts to ensure a broad range of \n                perspectives.\n                    (d) Agency heads shall provide a report summarizing \n                the results of the classification guidance review to \n                the Director of the Information Security Oversight \n                Office and shall release an unclassified version of \n                this report to the public.\n\n                PART 2--DERIVATIVE CLASSIFICATION\n\n                Sec. 2.1. Use of Derivative Classification. (a) Persons \n                who reproduce, extract, or summarize classified \n                information, or who apply classification markings \n                derived from source material or as directed by a \n                classification guide, need not possess original \n                classification authority.\n\n                    (b) Persons who apply derivative classification \n                markings shall:\n\n(1) be identified by name and position, or by personal identifier, in a \nmanner that is immediately apparent for each derivative classification \naction;\n\n(2) observe and respect original classification decisions; and\n\n(3) carry forward to any newly created documents the pertinent \nclassification markings. For information derivatively classified based on \nmultiple sources, the derivative classifier shall carry forward:\n\n  (A) the date or event for declassification that corresponds to the \nlongest period of classification among the sources, or the marking \nestablished pursuant to section 1.6(a)(4)(D) of this order; and\n\n  (B) a listing of the source materials.\n\n                    (c) Derivative classifiers shall, whenever \n                practicable, use a classified addendum whenever \n                classified information constitutes a small portion of \n                an otherwise unclassified document or prepare a product \n                to allow for dissemination at the lowest level of \n                classification possible or in unclassified form.\n                    (d) Persons who apply derivative classification \n                markings shall receive training in the proper \n                application of the derivative classification principles \n                of the order, with an emphasis on avoiding over-\n                classification, at least once every 2 years. Derivative \n                classifiers who do not receive such training at least \n                once every 2 years shall have their authority to apply \n                derivative classification markings suspended until they \n                have received such training. A waiver may be granted by \n                the agency head, the deputy agency head, or the senior \n                agency official if an individual is unable to receive \n                such training due to unavoidable circumstances. \n                Whenever a waiver is granted, the individual shall \n                receive such training as soon as practicable.\n\n                Sec. 2.2. Classification Guides. (a) Agencies with \n                original classification authority shall prepare \n                classification guides to facilitate the proper and \n                uniform derivative classification of information. These \n                guides shall conform to standards contained in \n                directives issued under this order.\n\n                    (b) Each guide shall be approved personally and in \n                writing by an official who:\n\n(1) has program or supervisory responsibility over the information or is \nthe senior agency official; and\n\n[[Page 713]]\n\n(2) is authorized to classify information originally at the highest level \nof classification prescribed in the guide.\n\n                    (c) Agencies shall establish procedures to ensure \n                that classification guides are reviewed and updated as \n                provided in directives issued under this order.\n                    (d) Agencies shall incorporate original \n                classification decisions into classification guides on \n                a timely basis and in accordance with directives issued \n                under this order.\n                    (e) Agencies may incorporate exemptions from \n                automatic declassification approved pursuant to section \n                3.3(j) of this order into classification guides, \n                provided that the Panel is notified of the intent to \n                take such action for specific information in advance of \n                approval and the information remains in active use.\n                    (f) The duration of classification of a document \n                classified by a derivative classifier using a \n                classification guide shall not exceed 25 years from the \n                date of the origin of the document, except for:\n\n(1) information that should clearly and demonstrably be expected to reveal \nthe identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source \nor key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction; and\n\n(2) specific information incorporated into classification guides in \naccordance with section 2.2(e) of this order.\n\n                PART 3--DECLASSIFICATION AND DOWNGRADING\n\n                Sec. 3.1. Authority for Declassification. (a) \n                Information shall be declassified as soon as it no \n                longer meets the standards for classification under \n                this order.\n\n                    (b) Information shall be declassified or downgraded \n                by:\n\n(1) the official who authorized the original classification, if that \nofficial is still serving in the same position and has original \nclassification authority;\n\n(2) the originator's current successor in function, if that individual has \noriginal classification authority;\n\n(3) a supervisory official of either the originator or his or her successor \nin function, if the supervisory official has original classification \nauthority; or (4) officials delegated declassification authority in writing \nby the agency head or the senior agency official of the originating agency.\n\n                    (c) The Director of National Intelligence (or, if \n                delegated by the Director of National Intelligence, the \n                Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence) \n                may, with respect to the Intelligence Community, after \n                consultation with the head of the originating \n                Intelligence Community element or department, \n                declassify, downgrade, or direct the declassification \n                or downgrading of information or intelligence relating \n                to intelligence sources, methods, or activities.\n                    (d) It is presumed that information that continues \n                to meet the classification requirements under this \n                order requires continued protection. In some \n                exceptional cases, however, the need to protect such \n                information may be outweighed by the public interest in \n                disclosure of the information, and in these cases the \n                information should be declassified. When such questions \n                arise, they shall be referred to the agency head or the \n                senior agency official. That official will determine, \n                as an exercise of discretion, whether the public \n                interest in disclosure outweighs the damage to the \n                national security that might reasonably be expected \n                from disclosure. This provision does not:\n\n(1) amplify or modify the substantive criteria or procedures for \nclassification; or\n\n(2) create any substantive or procedural rights subject to judicial review.\n\n                    (e) If the Director of the Information Security \n                Oversight Office determines that information is \n                classified in violation of this order, the Director may \n                require the information to be declassified by the \n                agency that originated the classification. Any such \n                decision by the Director may be appealed to the \n                President through the National Security Advisor. The \n                information shall remain classified pending a prompt \n                decision on the appeal.\n\n[[Page 714]]\n\n                    (f) The provisions of this section shall also apply \n                to agencies that, under the terms of this order, do not \n                have original classification authority, but had such \n                authority under predecessor orders.\n                    (g) No information may be excluded from \n                declassification under section 3.3 of this order based \n                solely on the type of document or record in which it is \n                found. Rather, the classified information must be \n                considered on the basis of its content.\n                    (h) Classified nonrecord materials, including \n                artifacts, shall be declassified as soon as they no \n                longer meet the standards for classification under this \n                order.\n                    (i) When making decisions under sections 3.3, 3.4, \n                and 3.5 of this order, agencies shall consider the \n                final decisions of the Panel.\n\n                Sec. 3.2. Transferred Records.\n\n                    (a) In the case of classified records transferred \n                in conjunction with a transfer of functions, and not \n                merely for storage purposes, the receiving agency shall \n                be deemed to be the originating agency for purposes of \n                this order.\n                    (b) In the case of classified records that are not \n                officially transferred as described in paragraph (a) of \n                this section, but that originated in an agency that has \n                ceased to exist and for which there is no successor \n                agency, each agency in possession of such records shall \n                be deemed to be the originating agency for purposes of \n                this order. Such records may be declassified or \n                downgraded by the agency in possession of the records \n                after consultation with any other agency that has an \n                interest in the subject matter of the records.\n                    (c) Classified records accessioned into the \n                National Archives shall be declassified or downgraded \n                by the Archivist in accordance with this order, the \n                directives issued pursuant to this order, agency \n                declassification guides, and any existing procedural \n                agreement between the Archivist and the relevant agency \n                head.\n                    (d) The originating agency shall take all \n                reasonable steps to declassify classified information \n                contained in records determined to have permanent \n                historical value before they are accessioned into the \n                National Archives. However, the Archivist may require \n                that classified records be accessioned into the \n                National Archives when necessary to comply with the \n                provisions of the Federal Records Act. This provision \n                does not apply to records transferred to the Archivist \n                pursuant to section 2203 of title 44, United States \n                Code, or records for which the National Archives serves \n                as the custodian of the records of an agency or \n                organization that has gone out of existence.\n                    (e) To the extent practicable, agencies shall adopt \n                a system of records management that will facilitate the \n                public release of documents at the time such documents \n                are declassified pursuant to the provisions for \n                automatic declassification in section 3.3 of this \n                order.\n\n                Sec. 3.3 Automatic Declassification.\n\n                    (a) Subject to paragraphs (b)-(d) and (g)-(j) of \n                this section, all classified records that (1) are more \n                than 25 years old and (2) have been determined to have \n                permanent historical value under title 44, United \n                States Code, shall be automatically declassified \n                whether or not the records have been reviewed. All \n                classified records shall be automatically declassified \n                on December 31 of the year that is 25 years from the \n                date of origin, except as provided in paragraphs (b)-\n                (d) and (g)-(j) of this section. If the date of origin \n                of an individual record cannot be readily determined, \n                the date of original classification shall be used \n                instead.\n                    (b) An agency head may exempt from automatic \n                declassification under paragraph (a) of this section \n                specific information, the release of which should \n                clearly and demonstrably be expected to:\n\n(1) reveal the identity of a confidential human source, a human \nintelligence source, a relationship with an intelligence or security \nservice of a foreign\n\n[[Page 715]]\n\ngovernment or international organization, or a nonhuman intelligence \nsource; or impair the effectiveness of an intelligence method currently in \nuse, available for use, or under development;\n\n(2) reveal information that would assist in the development, production, or \nuse of weapons of mass destruction;\n\n(3) reveal information that would impair U.S. cryptologic systems or \nactivities;\n\n(4) reveal information that would impair the application of state-of-the-\nart technology within a U.S. weapon system;\n\n(5) reveal formally named or numbered U.S. military war plans that remain \nin effect, or reveal operational or tactical elements of prior plans that \nare contained in such active plans;\n\n(6) reveal information, including foreign government information, that \nwould cause serious harm to relations between the United States and a \nforeign government, or to ongoing diplomatic activities of the United \nStates;\n\n(7) reveal information that would impair the current ability of United \nStates Government officials to protect the President, Vice President, and \nother protectees for whom protection services, in the interest of the \nnational security, are authorized;\n\n(8) reveal information that would seriously impair current national \nsecurity emergency preparedness plans or reveal current vulnerabilities of \nsystems, installations, or infrastructures relating to the national \nsecurity; or\n\n(9) violate a statute, treaty, or international agreement that does not \npermit the automatic or unilateral declassification of information at 25 \nyears.\n\n                    (c)(1) An agency head shall notify the Panel of any \n                specific file series of records for which a review or \n                assessment has determined that the information within \n                that file series almost invariably falls within one or \n                more of the exemption categories listed in paragraph \n                (b) of this section and that the agency proposes to \n                exempt from automatic declassification at 25 years.\n\n(2) The notification shall include:\n\n  (A) a description of the file series;\n\n  (B) an explanation of why the information within the file series is \nalmost invariably exempt from automatic declassification and why the \ninformation must remain classified for a longer period of time; and\n\n  (C) except when the information within the file series almost invariably \nidentifies a confidential human source or a human intelligence source or \nkey design concepts of weapons of mass destruction, a specific date or \nevent for declassification of the information, not to exceed December 31 of \nthe year that is 50 years from the date of origin of the records.\n\n(3) The Panel may direct the agency not to exempt a designated file series \nor to declassify the information within that series at an earlier date than \nrecommended. The agency head may appeal such a decision to the President \nthrough the National Security Advisor.\n\n(4) File series exemptions approved by the President prior to December 31, \n2008, shall remain valid without any additional agency action pending Panel \nreview by the later of December 31, 2010, or December 31 of the year that \nis 10 years from the date of previous approval.\n\n                    (d) The following provisions shall apply to the \n                onset of automatic declassification:\n\n(1) Classified records within an integral file block, as defined in this \norder, that are otherwise subject to automatic declassification under this \nsection shall not be automatically declassified until December 31 of the \nyear that is 25 years from the date of the most recent record within the \nfile block.\n\n[[Page 716]]\n\n(2) After consultation with the Director of the National Declassification \nCenter (the Center) established by section 3.7 of this order and before the \nrecords are subject to automatic declassification, an agency head or senior \nagency official may delay automatic declassification for up to five \nadditional years for classified information contained in media that make a \nreview for possible declassification exemptions more difficult or costly.\n\n(3) Other than for records that are properly exempted from automatic \ndeclassification, records containing classified information that originated \nwith other agencies or the disclosure of which would affect the interests \nor activities of other agencies with respect to the classified information \nand could reasonably be expected to fall under one or more of the \nexemptions in paragraph (b) of this section shall be identified prior to \nthe onset of automatic declassification for later referral to those \nagencies.\n\n  (A) The information of concern shall be referred by the Center \nestablished by section 3.7 of this order, or by the centralized facilities \nreferred to in section 3.7(e) of this order, in a prioritized and scheduled \nmanner determined by the Center.\n\n  (B) If an agency fails to provide a final determination on a referral \nmade by the Center within 1 year of referral, or by the centralized \nfacilities referred to in section 3.7(e) of this order within 3 years of \nreferral, its equities in the referred records shall be automatically \ndeclassified.\n\n  (C) If any disagreement arises between affected agencies and the Center \nregarding the referral review period, the Director of the Information \nSecurity Oversight Office shall determine the appropriate period of review \nof referred records.\n\n  (D) Referrals identified prior to the establishment of the Center by \nsection 3.7 of this order shall be subject to automatic declassification \nonly in accordance with subparagraphs (d)(3)(A)-(C) of this section.\n\n(4) After consultation with the Director of the Information Security \nOversight Office, an agency head may delay automatic declassification for \nup to 3 years from the date of discovery of classified records that were \ninadvertently not reviewed prior to the effective date of automatic \ndeclassification.\n\n                    (e) Information exempted from automatic \n                declassification under this section shall remain \n                subject to the mandatory and systematic \n                declassification review provisions of this order.\n                    (f) The Secretary of State shall determine when the \n                United States should commence negotiations with the \n                appropriate officials of a foreign government or \n                international organization of governments to modify any \n                treaty or international agreement that requires the \n                classification of information contained in records \n                affected by this section for a period longer than 25 \n                years from the date of its creation, unless the treaty \n                or international agreement pertains to information that \n                may otherwise remain classified beyond 25 years under \n                this section.\n                    (g) The Secretary of Energy shall determine when \n                information concerning foreign nuclear programs that \n                was removed from the Restricted Data category in order \n                to carry out provisions of the National Security Act of \n                1947, as amended, may be declassified. Unless otherwise \n                determined, such information shall be declassified when \n                comparable information concerning the United States \n                nuclear program is declassified.\n                    (h) Not later than 3 years from the effective date \n                of this order, all records exempted from automatic \n                declassification under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this \n                section shall be automatically declassified on December \n                31 of a year that is no more than 50 years from the \n                date of origin, subject to the following:\n\n(1) Records that contain information the release of which should clearly \nand demonstrably be expected to reveal the following are exempt from \nautomatic declassification at 50 years:\n\n[[Page 717]]\n\n  (A) the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence \nsource; or\n\n  (B) key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction.\n\n(2) In extraordinary cases, agency heads may, within 5 years of the onset \nof automatic declassification, propose to exempt additional specific \ninformation from declassification at 50 years.\n\n(3) Records exempted from automatic declassification under this paragraph \nshall be automatically declassified on December 31 of a year that is no \nmore than 75 years from the date of origin unless an agency head, within 5 \nyears of that date, proposes to exempt specific information from \ndeclassification at 75 years and the proposal is formally approved by the \nPanel.\n\n                    (i) Specific records exempted from automatic \n                declassification prior to the establishment of the \n                Center described in section 3.7 of this order shall be \n                subject to the provisions of paragraph (h) of this \n                section in a scheduled and prioritized manner \n                determined by the Center.\n                    (j) At least 1 year before information is subject \n                to automatic declassification under this section, an \n                agency head or senior agency official shall notify the \n                Director of the Information Security Oversight Office, \n                serving as Executive Secretary of the Panel, of any \n                specific information that the agency proposes to exempt \n                from automatic declassification under paragraphs (b) \n                and (h) of this section.\n\n(1) The notification shall include:\n\n  (A) a detailed description of the information, either by reference to \ninformation in specific records or in the form of a declassification guide;\n\n  (B) an explanation of why the information should be exempt from automatic \ndeclassification and must remain classified for a longer period of time; \nand\n\n  (C) a specific date or a specific and independently verifiable event for \nautomatic declassification of specific records that contain the information \nproposed for exemption.\n\n(2) The Panel may direct the agency not to exempt the information or to \ndeclassify it at an earlier date than recommended. An agency head may \nappeal such a decision to the President through the National Security \nAdvisor. The information will remain classified while such an appeal is \npending.\n\n                    (k) For information in a file series of records \n                determined not to have permanent historical value, the \n                duration of classification beyond 25 years shall be the \n                same as the disposition (destruction) date of those \n                records in each Agency Records Control Schedule or \n                General Records Schedule, although the duration of \n                classification shall be extended if the record has been \n                retained for business reasons beyond the scheduled \n                disposition date.\n\n                Sec. 3.4. Systematic Declassification Review.\n\n                    (a) Each agency that has originated classified \n                information under this order or its predecessors shall \n                establish and conduct a program for systematic \n                declassification review for records of permanent \n                historical value exempted from automatic \n                declassification under section 3.3 of this order. \n                Agencies shall prioritize their review of such records \n                in accordance with priorities established by the \n                Center.\n                    (b) The Archivist shall conduct a systematic \n                declassification review program for classified records:\n\n(1) accessioned into the National Archives; (2) transferred to the \nArchivist pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 2203; and (3) for which the National \nArchives serves as the custodian for an agency or organization that has \ngone out of existence.\n\n                Sec. 3.5. Mandatory Declassification Review.\n\n                    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this \n                section, all information classified under this order or \n                predecessor orders shall be subject to a review for \n                declassification by the originating agency if:\n\n[[Page 718]]\n\n(1) the request for a review describes the document or material containing \nthe information with sufficient specificity to enable the agency to locate \nit with a reasonable amount of effort;\n\n(2) the document or material containing the information responsive to the \nrequest is not contained within an operational file exempted from search \nand review, publication, and disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552 in accordance \nwith law; and\n\n(3) the information is not the subject of pending litigation.\n\n                    (b) Information originated by the incumbent \n                President or the incumbent Vice President; the \n                incumbent President's White House Staff or the \n                incumbent Vice President's Staff; committees, \n                commissions, or boards appointed by the incumbent \n                President; or other entities within the Executive \n                Office of the President that solely advise and assist \n                the incumbent President is exempted from the provisions \n                of paragraph (a) of this section. However, the \n                Archivist shall have the authority to review, \n                downgrade, and declassify papers or records of former \n                Presidents and Vice Presidents under the control of the \n                Archivist pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 2107, 2111, 2111 note, \n                or 2203. Review procedures developed by the Archivist \n                shall provide for consultation with agencies having \n                primary subject matter interest and shall be consistent \n                with the provisions of applicable laws or lawful \n                agreements that pertain to the respective Presidential \n                papers or records.

Policy. Historically black colleges and \n                universities (HBCUs) have made historic and ongoing \n                contributions to the general welfare and prosperity of \n                our country. Established by visionary leaders, \n                America's HBCUs, for over 150 years, have produced many \n                of the Nation's leaders in business, government, \n                academia, and the military and have provided \n                generations of American men and women with hope and \n                educational opportunity. The Nation's 105 HBCUs are \n                located in 20 States, the District of Columbia, and the \n                U.S. Virgin Islands and serve more than 300,000 \n                undergraduate and graduate students. These institutions \n                continue to be important engines of economic growth and \n                community service, and they are proven ladders of \n                intergenerational advancement for men and women of all \n                ethnic, racial, and economic backgrounds, especially \n                African Americans. These institutions also produce a \n                high number of baccalaureate recipients who go on to \n                assume leadership and service roles in their \n                communities and who successfully complete graduate and \n                professional degree programs.\n\n                Sec. 2.

Policy. Broadband access is essential to the \n                Nation's global competitiveness in the 21st century, \n                driving job creation, promoting innovation, and \n                expanding markets for American businesses. Broadband \n                access also affords public safety agencies the \n                opportunity for greater levels of effectiveness and \n                interoperability. While broadband infrastructure has \n                been deployed in a vast majority of communities across \n                the country, today too many areas still lack adequate \n                access to this crucial resource. For these areas, \n                decisions on access to Federal property and rights of \n                way can be essential to the deployment of both wired \n                and wireless broadband infrastructure. The Federal \n                Government controls nearly 30 percent of all land in \n                the United States, owns thousands of buildings, and \n                provides substantial funding for State and local \n                transportation infrastructure, creating significant \n                opportunities for executive departments and agencies \n                (agencies) to help expand broadband infrastructure.\n\n                Sec. 2. Broadband Deployment on Federal Property \n                Working Group. (a) In order to ensure a coordinated and \n                consistent approach in implementing agency procedures, \n                requirements, and policies related to access to Federal \n                lands, buildings, and rights of way, federally assisted \n                highways, and tribal lands to advance broadband \n                deployment, there is established a Broadband Deployment \n                on Federal Property Working Group (Working Group), to \n                be co-chaired by representatives designated by the \n                Administrator of General Services and the Secretary of \n                Homeland Security (Co-Chairs) from their respective \n                agencies, in consultation with the Director of the \n                Office of Science and Technology Policy (Director) and \n                in coordination with the Chief Performance Officer \n                (CPO).\n\n                (b) The Working Group shall be composed of:\n\n(i) a representative from each of the following agencies, and the Co-\nChairs, all of which have significant ownership of, or responsibility for \nmanaging, Federal lands, buildings, and rights of way, federally assisted \nhighways, and tribal lands (Broadband Member Agencies):\n\n(1) the Department of Defense;\n\n(2) the Department of the Interior;\n\n(3) the Department of Agriculture;\n\n(4) the Department of Commerce;\n\n(5) the Department of Transportation;\n\n(6) the Department of Veterans Affairs; and\n\n(7) the United States Postal Service;\n\n(ii) a representative from each of the following agencies or offices, to \nprovide advice and assistance:\n\n[[Page 36904]]\n\n(1) the Federal Communications Commission;\n\n(2) the Council on Environmental Quality;\n\n(3) the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation; and\n\n(4) the National Security Staff; and\n\n(iii) representatives from such other agencies or offices as the Co-Chairs \nmay invite to participate.\n\n                (c) Within 1 year of the date of this order, the \n                Working Group shall report to the Steering Committee on \n                Federal Infrastructure Permitting and Review Process \n                Improvement, established pursuant to Executive Order \n                13604 of March 22, 2012 (Improving Performance of \n                Federal Permitting and Review of Infrastructure \n                Projects), on the progress that has been made in \n                implementing the actions mandated by sections 3 through \n                5 of this order.\n\n                Sec. 3.

(a) \n                Each Broadband Member Agency, following coordination \n                with other Broadband Member Agencies and interested \n                non-member agencies, shall:\n\n(i) develop and implement a strategy to facilitate the timely and efficient \ndeployment of broadband facilities on Federal lands, buildings, and rights \nof way, federally assisted highways, and tribal lands, that:\n\n(1) ensures a consistent approach across the Federal Government that \nfacilitates broadband deployment processes and decisions, including by: \navoiding duplicative reviews; coordinating review processes; providing \nclear notice of all application and other requirements; ensuring consistent \ninterpretation and application of all procedures, requirements, and \npolicies; supporting decisions on deployment of broadband service to those \nliving on tribal lands consistent with existing statutes, treaties, and \ntrust responsibilities; and ensuring the public availability of current \ninformation on these matters;\n\n(2) where beneficial and appropriate, includes procedures for coordination \nwith State, local, and tribal governments, and other appropriate entities;\n\n(3) is coordinated with appropriate external stakeholders, as determined by \neach Broadband Member Agency, prior to implementation; and\n\n(4) is provided to the Co-Chairs within 180 days of the date of this order; \nand\n\n(ii) provide comprehensive and current information on accessing Federal \nlands, buildings, and rights of way, federally assisted highways, and \ntribal lands for the deployment of broadband facilities, and develop \nstrategies to increase the usefulness and accessibility of this \ninformation, including ensuring such information is available online and in \na format that is compatible with appropriate Government websites, such as \nthe Federal Infrastructure Projects Dashboard created pursuant to my \nmemorandum of August 31, 2011 (Speeding Infrastructure Development Through \nMore Efficient and Effective Permitting and Environmental Review).\n\n                (b) The activities conducted pursuant to subsection (a) \n                of this section, particularly with respect to the \n                establishment of timelines for permitting and review \n                processes, shall be consistent with Executive Order \n                13604 and with the Federal Plan and Agency Plans to be \n                developed pursuant to that order.\n\n                (c) The Co-Chairs, in consultation with the Director \n                and in coordination with the CPO, shall coordinate, \n                review, and monitor the development and implementation \n                of the strategies required by paragraph (a)(i) of this \n                section.\n\n                (d) Broadband Member Agencies may limit the information \n                made available pursuant to paragraph (a)(ii) of this \n                section as appropriate to accommodate national \n                security, public safety, and privacy concerns.\n\n                Sec. 4. Contracts, Applications, and Permits. (a) \n                Section 6409 of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job \n                Creation Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-96) contains \n                provisions addressing access to Federal property for \n                the deployment of wireless broadband facilities, \n                including requirements that the General Services\n\n[[Page 36905]]\n\n                Administration (GSA) develop application forms, master \n                contracts, and fees for such access. The GSA shall \n                consult with the Working Group in developing these \n                application forms, master contracts, and fees.\n\n                (b) To the extent not already addressed by section \n                6409, each Broadband Member Agency with responsibility \n                for managing Federal lands, buildings, or rights of way \n                (as determined by the Co-Chairs) shall, in coordination \n                with the Working Group and within 1 year of the date of \n                this order, develop and use one or more templates for \n                uniform contract, application, and permit terms to \n                facilitate nongovernment entities' use of Federal \n                property for the deployment of broadband facilities. \n                The templates shall, where appropriate, allow for \n                access by multiple broadband service providers and \n                public safety entities. To ensure a consistent approach \n                across the Federal Government and different broadband \n                technologies, the templates shall, to the extent \n                practicable and efficient, provide equal access to \n                Federal property for the deployment of wireline and \n                wireless facilities.\n\n                Sec. 5. Deployment of Conduit for Broadband Facilities \n                in Conjunction with Federal or Federally Assisted \n                Highway Construction. (a) The installation of \n                underground fiber conduit along highway and roadway \n                rights of way can improve traffic flow and safety \n                through implementation of intelligent transportation \n                systems (ITS) and reduce the cost of future broadband \n                deployment. Accordingly, within 1 year of the date of \n                this order:\n\n(i) the Department of Transportation, in consultation with the Working \nGroup, shall review dig once requirements in its existing programs and \nimplement a flexible set of best practices that can accommodate changes in \nbroadband technology and minimize excavations consistent with competitive \nbroadband deployment;\n\n(ii) the Department of Transportation shall work with State and local \ngovernments to help them develop and implement best practices on such \nmatters as establishing dig once requirements, effectively using private \ninvestment in State ITS infrastructure, determining fair market value for \nrights of way on federally assisted highways, and reestablishing any \nhighway assets disturbed by installation;\n\n(iii) the Department of the Interior and other Broadband Member Agencies \nwith responsibility for federally owned highways and rights of way on \ntribal lands (as determined by the Co-Chairs) shall revise their \nprocedures, requirements, and policies to include the use of dig once \nrequirements and similar policies to encourage the deployment of broadband \ninfrastructure in conjunction with Federal highway construction, as well as \nto provide for the reestablishment of any highway assets disturbed by \ninstallation;\n\n(iv) the Department of Transportation, after outreach to relevant \nnonfederal stakeholders, shall review and, if necessary, revise its \nguidance to State departments of transportation on allowing for-profit or \nother entities to accommodate or construct, safely and securely maintain, \nand utilize broadband facilities on State and locally owned rights of way \nin order to reflect changes in broadband technologies and markets and to \npromote competitive broadband infrastructure deployment; and\n\n(v) the Department of Transportation, in consultation with the Working \nGroup and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation \nOfficials, shall create an online platform that States and counties may use \nto aggregate and make publicly available their rights of way laws and joint \noccupancy guidelines and agreements.\n\n                (b) For the purposes of this section, the term ``dig \n                once requirements'' means requirements designed to \n                reduce the number and scale of repeated excavations for \n                the installation and maintenance of broadband \n                facilities in rights of way.\n\n                Sec. 6.
