To develop and maintain its \n                infrastructure facilities, our Nation relies heavily on \n                investments by the Federal Government.\n\n                Our Nation will achieve the greatest benefits from its \n                infrastructure facilities if it invests wisely and \n                continually improves the quality and performance of its \n                infrastructure programs. Therefore, by the authority \n                vested in me as President by the Constitution and the \n                laws of the United States of America, it is hereby \n                ordered as follows:\n\n                Section 1. Scope. The principles and plans referred to \n                in this order shall apply to Federal spending for \n                infrastructure programs. For the purposes of this \n                order, Federal spending for infrastructure programs \n                shall include direct spending and grants for \n                transportation, water resources, energy, and \n                environmental protection.\n\n                Sec. 2. Principles of Federal Infrastructure \n                Investment.\n\n                Each executive department and agency with \n                infrastructure responsibilities (hereinafter referred \n                to collectively as ``agencies'') shall develop and \n                implement plans for infrastructure investment and \n                management consistent with the following principles:\n\n                    (a) Systematic Analysis of Expected Benefits and \n                Costs. Infrastructure investments shall be based on \n                systematic analysis of expected benefits and costs, \n                including both quantitative and qualitative measures, \n                in accordance with the following:\n\n                (1) Benefits and costs should be quantified and \n                monetized to the maximum extent practicable. All types \n                of benefits and costs, both market and nonmarket, \n                should be considered. To the extent that environmental \n                and other nonmarket benefits and costs can be \n                quantified, they shall be given the same weight as \n                quantifiable market benefits and costs.\n\n                (2) Benefits and costs should be measured and \n                appropriately discounted over the full life cycle of \n                each project. Such analysis will enable informed \n                tradeoffs among capital outlays, operating and \n                maintenance costs, and nonmonetary costs borne by the \n                public.\n\n                (3) When the amount and timing of important benefits \n                and costs are uncertain, analyses shall recognize the \n                uncertainty and address it through appropriate \n                quantitative and qualitative assessments.\n\n                (4) Analyses shall compare a comprehensive set of \n                options that include, among other things, managing \n                demand, repairing facilities, and expanding facilities.\n\n                (5) Analyses should consider not only quantifiable \n                measures of benefits and costs, but also qualitative \n                measures reflecting values that are not readily \n                quantified.\n\n                    (b) Efficient Management. Infrastructure shall be \n                managed efficiently in accordance with the following:\n\n                (1) The efficient use of infrastructure depends not \n                only on physical design features, but also on \n                operational practices. To improve these practices, \n                agencies should conduct periodic reviews of the \n                operation and maintenance of existing facilities.\n\n                (2) Agencies should use these reviews to consider a \n                variety of management practices that can improve the \n                return from infrastructure investments. Examples \n                include contracting practices that reward quality and \n                innovation, and design standards that incorporate new \n                technologies and construction techniques.\n\n                (3) Agencies also should use these reviews to identify \n                the demand for different levels of infrastructure \n                services. Since efficient levels of service can often \n                best be achieved by properly pricing infrastructure, \n                the Federal Government--through its direct investments, \n                grants, and regulations--should promote consideration \n                of market-based mechanisms for managing infrastructure.\n\n                    (c) Private Sector Participation. Agencies shall \n                seek private sector participation in infrastructure \n                investment and management. Innovative public-private \n                initiatives can bring about greater private sector \n                participation in the ownership, financing, \n                construction, and operation of the infrastructure \n                programs referred to in section 1 of this order. \n                Consistent with the public interest, agencies should \n                work with State and local entities to minimize legal \n                and regulatory barriers to private sector participation \n                in the provision of infrastructure facilities and \n                services.\n                    (d) Encouragement of More Effective State and Local \n                Programs. To promote the efficient use of Federal \n                infrastructure funds, agencies should encourage the \n                State and local recipients of Federal grants to \n                implement planning and information management systems \n                that support the principles set forth in section 2(a) \n                through (c) of this order. In turn, the Federal \n                Government should use the information from the State \n                and local recipients' management systems to conduct the \n                system-level reviews of the Federal Government's \n                infrastructure programs that are required by this \n                order.\n\n                Sec. 3. Submission of Plans. Agencies shall submit \n                initial plans to implement these principles to the \n                Director of the Office of Management and Budget \n                (``OMB'') by March 15, 1994. Agency plans shall list \n                the actions that will be taken to provide the data and \n                analysis necessary for supporting infrastructure-\n                related proposals in future budget submissions. Agency \n                implementation plans should be consistent with OMB \n                Circular A-94 that outlines the analytical methods \n                required under the principles set forth in section 2 of \n                this order.\n\n                Sec. 4. Application to Budget Submissions. Beginning \n                with the fiscal year 1996 budget submission to OMB, \n                each agency should use these principles to justify \n                major infrastructure investment and grant programs. \n                Major programs are defined as those programs with \n                annual budgetary resources in excess of $50 million.\n\n                Sec. 5. Application to Legislative Proposals. Beginning \n                March 15, 1994, agencies shall employ the principles \n                set forth in section 2 of this order and, at the \n                request of OMB, shall provide supporting analyses when \n                requesting OMB clearance for legislative proposals that \n                would authorize or reauthorize infrastructure programs.\n\n                Sec. 6. Guidance. The Office of Management and Budget \n                shall provide guidance to the agencies on the \n                implementation of this order.\n\n                Sec. 7. Judicial Review. This order is intended only to \n                improve the internal management of the executive branch \n                and does not create any right or benefit, substantive \n                or procedural, enforceable by a party against the \n                United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its \n                officers or employees, or any other person.\n\n                    (Presidential Sig.)<clinton1>&gt;<clinton2>\n\n\n                THE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n                    January 26, 1994.\n\n[FR Doc. 94-2261\nFiled 1-27-94; 3:45 pm]\nBilling code 3195-01-P\n\n\n</clinton2></clinton1></pre>]","url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/1994/01/31/94-2261/principles-for-federal-infrastructure-investments","president":"clinton","id":"12893"},"reftime":1418257572295}

Establishment. (a) There shall be \n                established an Advisory Committee on Human Radiation \n                Experiments (the ``Advisory Committee'' or \n                ``Committee''). The Advisory Committee shall be \n                composed of not more than 15 members to be appointed or \n                designated by the President. The Advisory Committee \n                shall comply with the Federal Advisory Committee Act, \n                as amended, 5 U.S.C. App. 2.\n\n                    (b) The President shall designate a Chairperson \n                from among the members of the Advisory Committee.\n\n                Sec. 2. Functions. (a) There has been established a \n                Human Radiation Interagency Working Group, the members \n                of which include the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary \n                of Defense, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \n                the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Attorney \n                General, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics \n                and Space Administration, the Director of Central \n                Intelligence, and the Director of the Office of \n                Management and Budget. As set forth in paragraph (b) of \n                this section, the Advisory Committee shall provide to \n                the Human Radiation Interagency Working Group advice \n                and recommendations on the ethical and scientific \n                standards applicable to human radiation experiments \n                carried out or sponsored by the United States \n                Government. As used herein, ``human radiation \n                experiments'' means:\n\n                (1) experiments on individuals involving intentional \n                exposure to ionizing radiation. This category does not \n                include common and routine clinical practices, such as \n                established diagnosis and treatment methods, involving \n                incidental exposures to ionizing radiation;\n\n                (2) experiments involving intentional environmental \n                releases of radiation that (A) were designed to test \n                human health effects of ionizing radiation; or (B) were \n                designed to test the extent of human exposure to \n                ionizing radiation.\n\n                Consistent with the provisions set forth in paragraph \n                (b) of this section, the Advisory Committee shall also \n                provide advice, information, and recommendations on the \n                following experiments:\n\n                (1) the experiment into the atmospheric diffusion of \n                radioactive gases and test of detectability, commonly \n                referred to as ``the Green Run test,'' by the former \n                Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and the Air Force in \n                December 1949 at the Hanford Reservation in Richland, \n                Washington;\n\n                (2) two radiation warfare field experiments conducted \n                at the AEC's Oak Ridge office in 1948 involving gamma \n                radiation released from non-bomb point sources at or \n                near ground level;\n\n                (3) six tests conducted during 1949-1952 of radiation \n                warfare ballistic dispersal devices containing \n                radioactive agents at the U.S. Army's Dugway, Utah, \n                site;\n\n                (4) four atmospheric radiation-tracking tests in 1950 \n                at Los Alamos, New Mexico; and\n\n                (5) any other similar experiment that may later be \n                identified by the Human Radiation Interagency Working \n                Group.\n\n                The Advisory Committee shall review experiments \n                conducted from 1944 to May 30, 1974. Human radiation \n                experiments undertaken after May 30, 1974, the date of \n                issuance of the Department of Health, Education, and \n                Welfare (``DHEW'') Regulations for the Protection of \n                Human Subjects (45 C.F.R. 46), may be sampled to \n                determine whether further inquiry into experiments is \n                warranted. Further inquiry into experiments conducted \n                after May 30, 1974, may be pursued if the Advisory \n                Committee determines, with the concurrence of the Human \n                Radiation Interagency Working Group, that such inquiry \n                is warranted.\n\n                    (b)(1) The Advisory Committee shall determine the \n                ethical and scientific standards and criteria by which \n                it shall evaluate human radiation experiments, as set \n                forth in paragraph (a) of this section. The Advisory \n                Committee shall consider whether (A) there was a clear \n                medical or scientific purpose for the experiments; (B) \n                appropriate medical follow-up was conducted; and (C) \n                the experiments' design and administration adequately \n                met the ethical and scientific standards, including \n                standards of informed consent, that prevailed at the \n                time of the experiments and that exist today.\n\n                    (2) The Advisory Committee shall evaluate the \n                extent to which human radiation experiments were \n                consistent with applicable ethical and scientific \n                standards as determined by the Committee pursuant to \n                paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If deemed necessary \n                for such an assessment, the Committee may carry out a \n                detailed review of experiments and associated records \n                to the extent permitted by law.\n\n                    (3) If required to protect the health of \n                individuals who were subjects of a human radiation \n                experiment, or their descendants, the Advisory \n                Committee may recommend to the Human Radiation \n                Interagency Working Group that an agency notify \n                particular subjects of an experiment, or their \n                descendants, of any potential health risk or the need \n                for medical follow-up.\n\n                    (4) The Advisory Committee may recommend further \n                policies, as needed, to ensure compliance with \n                recommended ethical and scientific standards for human \n                radiation experiments.\n\n                    (5) The Advisory Committee may carry out such \n                additional functions as the Human Radiation Interagency \n                Working Group may from time to time request.\n\n                Sec. 3. Administration. (a) The heads of executive \n                departments and agencies shall, to the extent permitted \n                by law, provide the Advisory Committee with such \n                information as it may require for purposes of carrying \n                out its functions.\n\n                    (b) Members of the Advisory Committee shall be \n                compensated in accordance with Federal law.

Meigs \nAirfield. This zone is needed to safeguard all vessels and waterfront \nfacilities in these areas against destruction, loss, or injury from \nsabotage or other subversive acts, accidents, or other causes of a \nsimilar nature. This safety and security zone will be in effect at \nvarious times; these times will be published in the Coast Guard Local \nNotice to Mariners or broadcasted via Marine Radio VHF-FM Channels 16 &amp; \n22. When in effect, entry into this zone in prohibited unless \nauthorized by the Captain of the Port Chicago.\n\nDATES: Comments must be received on or before July 26, 1994.\n\nADDRESSES: Comments and supporting materials should be mailed or \ndelivered to the Case Management &amp; Port Safety Section, Ninth Coast \nGuard District, room 2069, 1240 East Ninth Street, Cleveland, Ohio, \n44199-2060, (216) 522-3994. Please reference the name of the proposal \nand the docket number in the heading above. If you wish receipt of your \nmailed comment to be acknowledged, please include a stamped self-\naddressed envelope or postcard for that purpose. Comments and materials \nreceived will be available for public inspection at the above location \nfrom 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday.\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lieutenant (junior grade) Benjamin L. \nSmith, Project Manager, Case Management &amp; Port Safety Section, Ninth \nCoast Guard District, (216) 522-3994.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:\n\nRequest for Comments\n\n    The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to participate in \nthis rulemaking by submitting comments which may consist of data, \nviews, arguments, or proposals for amendments to the proposed \nregulation. The Coast Guard does not currently plan to have a public \nhearing, but consideration will be given to holding such a hearing if \nit is requested. Such a request should indicate how a public hearing \nwould contribute substantial information or views which cannot be \nreceived in written form. If it appears that a public hearing would \nsubstantially contribute to revisions or further refinements of this \nrulemaking, the Coast Guard will announce such a hearing by a later \nnotice in the Federal Register.\n\nBackground and Purpose\n\n    The purpose of this regulation is to support the U.S. Secret \nservice in performing statutory protective duties. The goal is ensure \nthe safety and security of the President and other officials that may \nperiodically arrive at Merrill C. Meigs Airfield on short notice; and \nto protect all members of the public in the area. This safety and \nsecurity zone will be in affect at various times; these times will be \npublished in the Coast Guard Local Notice to Mariners or broadcasted \nvia Marine Radio VHF-FM Channels 16 &amp; 22. This regulation is issued \npursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1231 and 50 U.S.C 191 as a set out in the \nauthority citation for all 33 CFR part 165.\n\nDrafting Information\n\n    The principal persons involved in drafting this document are \nLieutenant (junior grade) Benjamin L. Smith, Project Manager, and \nCommander Robert G. Blythe, Project Counsel.\n\nEnvironment\n\n    The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this \nregulation and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.c of Coast Guard \nCommandant Instruction M16475.1B, it is categorically excluded from \nfurther environmental documentation.\n\nFederalism\n\n    This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and \ncriteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined \nthat the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism \nimplications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. \nThis regulation does not impose any new regulatory requirements in an \narea not heretofore regulated by the Federal Government, and does not \nimpose any requirements or restrictions on State or local authorities.\n\nRegulatory Evaluation\n\n    Proposal is not considered a significant regulatory action under \nExecutive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review and is not \nsignificant under Department of Transportation regulatory policies and \nprocedures (44 FR 11034 of February 26, 1979).\n\nSmall Entities\n\n    The impact of this regulation is expected to be so minimal that a \nfull regulatory evaluation is unnecessary. The Coast Guard therefore \ncertifies that, if adopted, it will not have a significant economic \nimpact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.\n\nCollection of Information\n\n    This regulation will impose no collection of information \nrequirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.\n\nList of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 165\n\n    Harbors, Marine safety, Navigation (water), (Reporting and \nrecordkeeping requirement, Security measures, Waterways.\n\nProposed Regulations\n\n    In consideration of the foregoing, the Coast Guard proposes to \namend subpart F of part 165 of title 33, Code of Federal Regulations, \nas follows:\n    1. The authority citation for part 165 continues to read as \nfollows:\n\n    Authority: 33 U.S.C. 1231; 50 U.S.C. 191; 33 CFR 1.05-1(g), 604-\n1, 6.04-6, and 160.5; and 49 CFR 1.46.\n\n    2. A new Sec. 165.904 is added to read as follows:\n\n\nSec. 165.904  Lake Michigan at Chicago Harbor &amp; Burnham Park Habor--\nSafety and Security Zone.\n\n    (a) Location. All waters, waterfront facilities, and shoreline \nareas within 1000 yards of the shoreline surrounding Merrill C. Meigs \nAirfield constitute a safety and security zone. This includes all \nwaters including Burnham Park Harbor and the southern part of Chicago \nHarbor, Lake Michigan, bounded by the following coordinates;\n    (1) Northwest point: 41 deg.52'33'' N, 87 deg.36'58'' W\n    (2) Northeast point: 41 deg.52'33'' N, 87 deg.35'41'' W\n    (3) Southeast point: 41 deg.50'42'' N, 87 deg.35'41'' W\n    (4) Southwest point: 41 deg.50'42'' N, 87 deg.36'32'' W\n    (5) from the southwest point, north along the Lake Michigan \nshoreline, including Burnham Park Harbor, to the northwest point.\n    (b) Effective times and dates. This safety and security zone will \nbe in effect at various times to be published in the Coast Guard Local \nNotice to Mariners or broadcasted via Marine Radio VHF-FM Channels 16 &amp; \n22. These times will include the actual effective time and date and the \ntermination time and date.\n    (c) Restrictions. (1) In accordance with the general regulations in \nSecs. 165.23 and 165.33 of this part, entry into this zone is \nprohibited, unless authorized by the U.S. Coast Guard Captain of the \nPort, Chicago, or the U.S. Secret Service. Other general requirements \nin Secs. 165.23 and 165.33 also apply. Further, no person may enter or \nremain in the shoreline areas of the established safety and security \nzone, unless cleared by a U.S. Coast Guard or U.S. Secret Service \nofficial.\n    (2) Vessels in Burnham Park Harbor at the commencement of the \nsafety and security zone must be moored and remain moored while the \nsafety and security zone is established, unless authorized to get \nunderway by a U.S. Coast Guard or U.S. Secret Service official.\n    (3) No person may engage in swimming, snorkeling, or diving within \nthe established safety and security zone, except with the permission of \nthe Captain of the Port or U.S. Secret Service.\n\n    Dated: April 26, 1994.\nClay A.

To \n                the extent authorized by law, such sanctions may \n                include:\n\n                    (a) cancellation or termination of agreements or \n                contracts with such person, entity, or any State or \n                local public agency;\n                    (b) refusal to extend any further aid under any \n                program or activity administered by it and affected by \n                this order until it is satisfied that the affected \n                person, entity, or State or local public agency will \n                comply with the rules, regulations, and procedures \n                issued or adopted pursuant to this order;\n                    (c) refusal to grant supervisory or regulatory \n                approval to such person, entity, or State or local \n                public agency under any program or activity \n                administered by it that is affected by this order or \n                revoke such approval if previously given; and\n                    (d) any other action as may be appropriate under \n                law.\n\n                5-503. Findings of any violation under section 5-502 of \n                this order shall be promptly reported by the head of \n                each executive agency to the Secretary of Housing and \n                Urban Development and the Attorney General.

Any executive agency shall also consider \n                invoking appropriate sanctions against any person or \n                entity where any other executive department or agency \n                has initiated action against that person or entity \n                pursuant to section 5-502 of this order, where the \n                Secretary of Housing and Urban Development has issued a \n                charge against such person or entity that has not been \n                resolved, or where the Attorney General has filed a \n                civil action in Federal Court against such person or \n                entity.\n\n                5-505.

The Department of Housing and \n                Urban Development, the Department of Justice, and \n                Federal banking agencies shall develop and coordinate \n                appropriate policies and procedures for taking action \n                under their respective authorities.

In \n                addition, the Secretary shall consult with the Attorney \n                General regarding all regulations and procedures \n                proposed to be issued under sections 4-401 and 4-402 of \n                this order to assure consistency with coordinated \n                Federal efforts to enforce nondiscrimination \n                requirements in programs of Federal financial \n                assistance pursuant to Executive Order No. 12250.\n\n                6-603.

Policy Statement. It is the policy of the \n                United States Government that all department and agency \n                heads and all Federal employees involved in the \n                procurement of any and all goods and services shall \n                assist SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs, as applicable, to develop \n                viable, self-sustaining businesses capable of competing \n                on an equal basis in the mainstream of the American \n                economy. To that end, all Federal personnel shall \n                commit to the letter and spirit of all laws promoting \n                the participation of SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs in Federal \n                procurement. The laws promote:\n\n                    (a) the award of contracts to SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs \n                through the Small Business Administration Section 8(a) \n                Program, the Department of Defense Small and \n                Disadvantaged Business Program, other agency programs, \n                and through other specific statutory authority or \n                appropriate means;\n                    (b) the establishment of particular goals for SDBs, \n                HBCUs, or MIs on an agency-by-agency basis and the \n                requirement that prime contractors and other recipients \n                of Federal funds attain similar goals in their \n                procurement; and\n                    (c) the establishment of other mechanisms that \n                ensure that SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs have a fair \n                opportunity to participate in Federal procurement.\n\n                Sec. 2. Attainment of Goals. All departments and \n                agencies are required by law to establish participation \n                goals of not less than 5 percent (15 U.S.C. 644(g)) or \n                a greater percentage where otherwise required by law, \n                as further provided in the Office of Federal \n                Procurement Policy Letter No. 91-1 of March 11, 1991. \n                Although the Federal Government has made substantial \n                strides toward meeting established SDB, HBCU, and MI \n                participation goals, certain departments and agencies \n                have from time to time failed to aggressively pursue \n                such goals. Department and agency heads are henceforth \n                directed to execute, implement, and otherwise \n                aggressively strive to fulfill the statutorily-mandated \n                procurement participation goals. In addition, all \n                departments and agencies are encouraged to set \n                reasonable participation goals that exceed statutory \n                requirements, to the extent permitted by law.\n\n                Sec. 3. Subcontracting Plans. The Small Business Act, \n                (15 U.S.C. 637(d)) and other related laws require \n                certain prime contractors to maximize the use of SDBs \n                in subcontracting plans and strive to achieve stated \n                goals through prime contractors' subcontracting \n                practices. Department and agency heads are directed to \n                aggressively enforce these prime contractors' \n                obligations to maximize awards of subcontracts to \n                eligible SDBs.\n\n                Sec. 4. Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business \n                Utilization (``OSDBU'').\n\n                    (a) Section 15(k) of the Small Business Act (15 \n                U.S.C. 644(k)) establishes in each Federal department \n                and agency an OSDBU and requires that the Director of \n                the OSDBU ``be responsible only to, and report directly \n                to, the head of such agency or to the deputy of such \n                head'' (15 U.S.C. 644(k)(3)). To the extent not \n                prohibited by law, each department and agency shall \n                ensure that the aforementioned direct reporting \n                requirements are henceforth vigorously enforced.\n                    (b) Because of the importance of the OSDBU \n                function, each department and agency shall also, to the \n                extent not prohibited by law, comply with the Office of \n                Federal Procurement Policy Letter No. 79-1 of March 7, \n                1979, which provides implementation guidance on section \n                15k and the organizational placement and functions of \n                the OSDBU.\n\n                Sec. 5. Anti-fraud Enforcement. All department and \n                agency heads shall ensure that in enforcing the laws \n                and requirements mentioned in this order, Federal \n                benefits or contracts intended for SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs \n                are not awarded to entities that are not legitimate \n                SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs. Department and agency anti-fraud \n                enforcement, however, shall not diminish agency vigor \n                in achieving the aforementioned participation goals, \n                which exist to promote the development of legitimate \n                SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs. Nothing herein is intended to \n                change self-certification requirements.\n\n                Sec. 6. Periodic Reports to the President. The \n                Administrator of the Small Business Administration and \n                the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement \n                Policy shall report to the President periodically on \n                the progress of all departments and agencies in \n                complying with the laws and requirements mentioned in \n                this order.\n\n                Sec. 7. Independent Agencies. Independent agencies are \n                requested to comply with the provisions of this order.\n\n                Sec. 8. This order shall be effective immediately.\n\n                    (Presidential Sig.)<clinton1>&gt;<clinton2>\n\n\n                THE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n                    September 16, 1994.\n\n[FR Doc. 94-23453\nFiled 9-19-94; 10:59 am]\nBilling code 3195-01-P\n\n\n</clinton2></clinton1></pre>]","url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/1994/09/20/94-23453/promoting-procurement-with-small-businesses-owned-and-controlled-by-socially-and-economically","president":"clinton","id":"12928"},"reftime":1418257577163}

In order to operate \n                as effectively as possible, by receiving timely goods \n                and quality services, the Federal Government must \n                assist the entities with which it has contractual \n                relations to develop stable relationships with their \n                employees.\n\n                An important aspect of a stable collective bargaining \n                relationship is the balance between allowing businesses \n                to operate during a strike and preserving worker \n                rights. This balance is disrupted when permanent \n                replacement employees are hired. It has been found that \n                strikes involving permanent replacement workers are \n                longer in duration than other strikes. In addition, the \n                use of permanent replacements can change a limited \n                dispute into a broader, more contentious struggle, \n                thereby exacerbating the problems that initially led to \n                the strike. By permanently replacing its workers, an \n                employer loses the accumulated knowledge, experience, \n                skill, and expertise of its incumbent employees. These \n                circumstances then adversely affect the businesses and \n                entities, such as the Federal Government, which rely on \n                that employer to provide high quality and reliable \n                goods or services.\n\n                NOW, THEREFORE, to ensure the economical and efficient \n                administration and completion of Federal Government \n                contracts, and by the authority vested in me as \n                President by the Constitution and the laws of the \n                United States of America, including 40 U.S.C. 486(a) \n                and 3 U.S.C. 301, it is hereby ordered as follows:\n\n                Section 1. It is the policy of the executive branch in \n                procuring goods and services that, to ensure the \n                economical and efficient administration and completion \n                of Federal Government contracts, contracting agencies \n                shall not contract with employers that permanently \n                replace lawfully striking employees. All discretion \n                under this Executive order shall be exercised \n                consistent with this policy.\n\n                Sec. 2. (a) The Secretary of Labor (``Secretary'') may \n                investigate an organizational unit of a Federal \n                contractor to determine whether the unit has \n                permanently replaced lawfully striking workers. Such \n                investigation shall be conducted in accordance with \n                procedures established by the Secretary.\n\n                    (b) The Secretary shall receive and may investigate \n                complaints by employees of any entity covered under \n                section 2(a) of this order where such complaints allege \n                lawfully striking employees have been permanently \n                replaced.\n                    (c) The Secretary may hold such hearings, public or \n                private, as he or she deems advisable, to determine \n                whether an entity covered under section 2(a) has \n                permanently replaced lawfully striking employees.\n\n                Sec. 3. (a) When the Secretary determines that a \n                contractor has permanently replaced lawfully striking \n                employees, the Secretary may make a finding that it is \n                appropriate to terminate the contract for convenience. \n                The Secretary shall transmit that finding to the head \n                of any department or agency that contracts with the \n                contractor. [[Page 13024]] \n\n                    (b) The head of the contracting department or \n                agency may object to the termination for convenience of \n                a contract or contracts of a contractor determined to \n                have permanently replaced legally striking employees. \n                If the head of the agency so objects, he or she shall \n                set forth the reasons for not terminating the contract \n                or contracts in a response in writing to the Secretary. \n                In such case, the termination for convenience shall not \n                be issued. The head of the contracting agency or \n                department shall report to the Secretary those \n                contracts that have been terminated for convenience \n                under this section.\n\n                Sec. 4. (a) When the Secretary determines that a \n                contractor has permanently replaced lawfully striking \n                employees, the Secretary may debar the contractor, \n                thereby making the contractor ineligible to receive \n                government contracts. The Secretary shall notify the \n                Administrator of the General Services Administration of \n                the debarment, and the Administrator shall include the \n                contractor on the consolidated list of debarred \n                contractors. Departments and agencies shall not solicit \n                offers from, award contracts to, or consent to \n                subcontracts with these contractors unless the head of \n                the agency or his or her designee determines, in \n                writing, that there is a compelling reason for such \n                action, in accordance with the Federal Acquisition \n                Regulation.\n\n                    (b) The scope of the debarment normally will be \n                limited to those organizational units of a Federal \n                contractor that the Secretary finds to have permanently \n                replaced lawfully striking workers.\n                    (c) The period of the debarment may not extend \n                beyond the date when the labor dispute precipitating \n                the permanent replacement of lawfully striking workers \n                has been resolved, as determined by the Secretary.\n\n                Sec. 5. The Secretary shall publish or cause to be \n                published, in the Federal Register, the names of \n                contractors that have, in the judgement of the \n                Secretary, permanently replaced lawfully striking \n                employees and have been the subject of debarment.\n\n                Sec. 6. The Secretary shall be responsible for the \n                administration and enforcement of this order. The \n                Secretary, after consultation with the Secretary of \n                Defense, the Administrator of the General Services, the \n                Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space \n                Administration, and the Administrator of the Office of \n                Federal Procurement Policy, may adopt such rules and \n                regulations and issue such orders as may be deemed \n                necessary and appropriate to achieve the purposes of \n                this order.\n\n                Sec. 7. Each contracting department and agency shall \n                cooperate with the Secretary and provide such \n                information and assistance as the Secretary may require \n                in the performance of the Secretary's functions under \n                this order.\n\n                Sec. 8. The Secretary may delegate any function or duty \n                of the Secretary under this order to any officer in the \n                Department of Labor or to any other officer in the \n                executive branch of the Government, with the consent of \n                the head of the department or agency in which that \n                officer serves.\n\n                Sec. 9. The Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of \n                the General Services, and the Administrator of the \n                National Aeronautics and Space Administration, after \n                consultation with the Administrator of the Office of \n                Federal Procurement Policy, shall take whatever action \n                is appropriate to implement the provisions of this \n                order and of any related rules, regulations, or orders \n                of the Secretary issued pursuant to this order.\n\n                Sec. 10.

The immediate nature of this \ncall to active duty, and the potential for a service period of up to \n270 days, may result in lack of access or disruption in continuity of \nrequired health care services for the affected family members. An \nextended absence from existing employment may result in the loss of \nemployer-sponsored health insurance, and the immediacy of the call-up \nleaves little flexibility for alternate arrangements. Additionally, \nalthough family members of reservists called to active duty for 31 or \nmore days will become eligible for CHAMPUS, they will face full payment \nof an annual deductible before CHAMPUS will begin cost sharing medical \nexpenses. In the case of E-4's and below, this amount is $50 per \nindividual, $100 for family; for E-5's and above the amount is $150 per \nindividual and $300 for family. Payment of this out-of-pocket cost may \nhave an adverse impact on some economically vulnerable personnel, \nespecially if they have already paid an annual deductible for their \nemployer sponsored insurance. In previous surveys of reservists \nactivated for Desert Storm, 55% of enlisted members and 45% of officers \ncalled to active duty reported a loss in income.\n    As a matter of general DoD personnel policy, reservists called to \nactive duty for periods of 31 days or more should be treated comparably \nto regular active duty members. Consistent with this policy, the family \nmembers of these reservists called to active duty in support of \nOperation Joint Endeavor became eligible for CHAMPUS. However, the \nnormal CHAMPUS deductible requirement presents an inequity for these \nfamilies. Because health program deductibles are premised on coverage \nfor an entire year, a beneficiary who receives coverage for a much \nshorter period receives unfavorable treatment. It is quite likely that \nsuch beneficiaries will be required to meet a second annual deductible \nunder another health plan that will provide coverage during those \nmonths of the year in which the reservist returns to his or her \ncivilian job. This demonstration project is designed to test an \napproach for addressing this special inequity.\n    The Department's effective response to potential disruption or loss \nof access to medical care for family members requires careful review of \noperational and administrative mechanisms which can ease this hardship \nin the transition from reserve to active duty status. This \ndemonstration is proposed for the purpose of testing whether \nelimination of the annual deductible normally collected under standard \nCHAMPUS will avoid unusual out-of-pocket costs, disruption of \ncontinuity in care, impaired access and problems with beneficiary \nsatisfaction for activated reservists. The demonstration would waive \nthe CHAMPUS deductible for all reservists called to active duty for \nOperation Joint Endeavor for periods of 31 days or more and allow \nCHAMPUS to immediately begin cost-sharing in accordance with standard \nCHAMPUS rules. The limited nature of this Presidential Selected Reserve \ncall-up for Operation Joint Endeavor reduces the number of activated \nreservists and family members which will be available in any given \ngeographic area. Therefore, to achieve a level of participation \nsufficient to test new strategies, this demonstration will occur \nnationwide. Demonstration participants will include family members of \nall Selected Reserve members called to active duty for a period of 31 \ndays or more as a result of Executive Order 12982 of December 8, 1995. \nUnder Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 1092, the Department is authorized \nto test different methods of financing delivery of health care services \nunder CHAMPUS.\n\nDATES: Effective December 8, 1995, family members of selected reserve \nmembers called to active duty for 31 days or more as a result of \nExecutive Order 12982, December 8, 1995, and who, as a result of that \nExecutive Order become eligible for services under CHAMPUS, may obtain \nthose services without paying deductibles normally required under \nstandard CHAMPUS. CHAMPUS eligible beneficiaries other than family \nmembers of reservists called to active duty for Operation Joint \nEndeavor are not eligible for participation. In view of the immediacy \nof the deployment, we are waiving the normal thirty-day advance notice \nfor beginning a CHAMPUS demonstration project.\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:\nCAPT Deborah Kamin, Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense \n(Health Affairs), (703)-697-8975.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Office of the Assistant Secretary of \nDefense (Health Affairs) will act as executive agent for purposes of \nthis demonstration and will assume overall responsibility for \ndemonstration policy, implementation, and monitoring.\nDURATION: This demonstration will operate for one year unless extended \nby separate action. Continuation of the program will depend on a \nprogram evaluation conducted following termination of the project. It \nis our hypothesis that elimination of normally imposed CHAMPUS \ndeductibles for this special group of beneficiaries will ease potential \nfinancial hardship caused by unexpected increases in out-of-pocket \nhealth care costs, avoid disruption of continuity and access to care, \nand minimize beneficiary dissatisfaction in transition from reserve to \nactive status. This support is an important element in the welfare of \nservicemembers and their families who are called to a significant and \nimmediate change in life circumstances. Information and experience \ngained as part of this demonstration will provide the foundation for \nlonger term solutions in the event of future reserve activation.\n\nEXCLUSIONS TO THE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT: Participation in this \ndemonstration is limited to active duty family members who become \neligible for CHAMPUS as a result of selected reserve activation in \nsupport of Operation Joint Endeavor. This demonstration is limited to \nthe annual CHAMPUS deductible; other CHAMPUS cost sharing continues to \napply. All current CHAMPUS rules, unless this notice specifically \nprovides otherwise, will continue to apply. The changes under this \ndemonstration will have an effective date of December 8, 1995.\n\n    Dated: February 1, 1996.\nL.M.

Stability and \n                dependability are important elements of economy and \n                efficiency. A contractor whose work force is less \n                stable will be less likely to produce goods and \n                services economically and efficiently than a contractor \n                whose work force is more stable. It remains the policy \n                of this Administration to enforce the immigration laws \n                to the fullest extent, including the detection and \n                deportation of illegal aliens. In these circumstances, \n                contractors cannot rely on the continuing availability \n                and service of illegal aliens, and contractors that \n                choose to employ unauthorized aliens inevitably will \n                have a less stable and less dependable work force than \n                contractors that do not employ such persons. Because of \n                this Administration's vigorous enforcement policy, \n                contractors that employ unauthorized alien workers are \n                necessarily less stable and dependable procurement \n                sources than contractors that do not hire such persons. \n                I find, therefore, that adherence to the general policy \n                of not contracting with providers that knowingly employ \n                unauthorized alien workers will promote economy and \n                efficiency in Federal procurement.\n\n                NOW, THEREFORE, to ensure the economical and efficient \n                administration and completion of Federal Government \n                contracts, and by the authority vested in me as \n                President by the Constitution and the laws of the \n                United States of America, including 40 U.S.C. 486(a) \n                and 3 U.S.C. 301, it is hereby ordered as follows:\n\n                Section 1. (a) It is the policy of the executive branch \n                in procuring goods and services that, to ensure the \n                economical and efficient administration and completion \n                of Federal Government contracts, contracting agencies \n                should not contract with employers that have not \n                complied with section 274A(a)(1)(A) and 274A(a)(2) of \n                the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n                1324a(a)(1)(A), 1324a(a)(2)) (the ``INA employment \n                provisions'') prohibiting the unlawful employment of \n                aliens. All discretion under this Executive order shall \n                be exercised consistent with this policy.\n\n                    (b) It remains the policy of this Administration to \n                fully and aggressively enforce the antidiscrimination \n                provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act to \n                the fullest extent. Nothing in this order relieves \n                employers from their obligation to avoid unfair \n                immigration-related employment practices as required by \n                the antidiscrimination provisions of section 1324(b) of \n                the INA (8 U.S.C. 1324b) and all other \n                antidiscrimination requirements of applicable law, \n                including the requirements of 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(6) \n                concerning the treatment of certain documentary \n                practices as unfair immigration-related employment \n                practices.\n\n                Sec. 2. Contractor, as used in this Executive order, \n                shall have the same meaning as defined in subpart 9.4 \n                of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.\n\n                Sec. 3. Using the procedures established pursuant to 8 \n                U.S.C. 1324a(e), the Attorney General: (a) may \n                investigate to determine whether a contractor or an \n                organizational unit thereof is not in compliance with \n                the INA employment provisions;\n\n                    (b) shall receive and may investigate complaints by \n                employees of any entity covered under section 3(a) of \n                this order where such complaints allege noncompliance \n                with the INA employment provisions; and \n                \n[[Page 6092]]\n\n                    (c) shall hold such hearings as are required under \n                8 U.S.C. 1324a(e) to determine whether an entity \n                covered under section 3(a) is not in compliance with \n                the INA employment provisions.\n\n                Sec. 4. (a) Whenever the Attorney General determines \n                that a contractor or an organizational unit thereof is \n                not in compliance with the INA employment provisions, \n                the Attorney General shall transmit that determination \n                to the appropriate contracting agency and such other \n                Federal agencies as the Attorney General may determine. \n                Upon receipt of such determination from the Attorney \n                General, the head of the appropriate contracting agency \n                shall consider the contractor or an organizational unit \n                thereof for debarment as well as for such other action \n                as may be appropriate in accordance with the procedures \n                and standards prescribed by the Federal Acquisition \n                Regulation.\n\n                    (b) The head of the contracting agency may debar \n                the contractor or an organizational unit thereof based \n                on the determination of the Attorney General that it is \n                not in compliance with the INA employment provisions. \n                The Attorney General's determination shall not be \n                reviewable in the debarment proceedings.\n                    (c) The scope of the debarment generally should be \n                limited to those organizational units of a Federal \n                contractor that the Attorney General finds are not in \n                compliance with the INA employment provisions.\n                    (d) The period of the debarment shall be for 1 year \n                and may be extended for additional periods of 1 year \n                if, using the procedures established pursuant to 8 \n                U.S.C. 1324a(e), the Attorney General determines that \n                the organizational unit of the Federal contractor \n                continues to be in violation of the INA employment \n                provisions.\n                    (e) The Administrator of General Services shall \n                list a debarred contractor or an organizational unit \n                thereof on the List of Parties Excluded from Federal \n                Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs and the \n                contractor or an organizational unit thereof shall be \n                ineligible to participate in any procurement or \n                nonprocurement activities.\n\n                Sec. 5. (a) The Attorney General shall be responsible \n                for the administration and enforcement of this order, \n                except for the debarment procedures. The Attorney \n                General may adopt such additional rules and regulations \n                and issue such orders as may be deemed necessary and \n                appropriate to carry out the responsibilities of the \n                Attorney General under this order. If the Attorney \n                General proposes to issue rules, regulations, or orders \n                that affect the contracting departments and agencies, \n                the Attorney General shall consult with the Secretary \n                of Defense, the Secretary of Labor, the Administrator \n                of General Services, the Administrator of the National \n                Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Administrator \n                for Federal Procurement Policy, and such other agencies \n                as may be appropriate.\n\n                    (b) The Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of \n                General Services, and the Administrator of the National \n                Aeronautics and Space Administration shall amend the \n                Federal Acquisition Regulation to the extent necessary \n                and appropriate to implement the debarment \n                responsibility and other related responsibilities \n                assigned to heads of contracting departments and \n                agencies under this order.\n\n                Sec. 6. Each contracting department and agency shall \n                cooperate with and provide such information and \n                assistance to the Attorney General as may be required \n                in the performance of the Attorney General's functions \n                under this order.\n\n                Sec. 7. The Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense, \n                the Administrator of General Services, the \n                Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space \n                Administration, and the heads of contracting \n                departments and agencies may delegate any of their \n                functions or duties under this order to any officer or \n                employee of their respective agencies. \n                \n[[Page 6093]]\n\n\n                Sec. 8. This order shall be implemented in a manner \n                intended to least burden the procurement process. This \n                order neither authorizes nor requires any additional \n                certification provision, clause, or requirement to be \n                included in any contract or contract solicitation.\n\n                Sec. 9. This order is not intended, and should not be \n                construed, to create any right or benefit, substantive \n                or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against \n                the United States, its agencies, its officers, or its \n                employees.

Part I of the Manual for Courts-Martial, \n                United States, 1984, is amended as follows:\n\n                Preamble, paragraph 4, is amended to read as follows:\n\n                    ``4. Structure and application of the Manual for \n                Courts-Martial.\n\n                The Manual for Courts-Martial shall consist of this \n                Preamble, the Rules for Courts-Martial, the Military \n                Rules of Evidence, the Punitive Articles, and the \n                Nonjudicial Punishment Procedures (Parts I-V).

Part II of the Manual for Courts-Martial, \n                United States, 1984, is amended to read as follows:\n\n                a. R.C.M. 810(d) is amended to read as follows:\n\n                    ``(d) Sentence limitations.\n                      (1) In general. Sentences at rehearings, new \n                trials, or other trials shall be adjudged within the \n                limitations set forth in R.C.M. 1003. Except as \n                otherwise provided in subsection (d)(2) of this rule, \n                offenses on which a rehearing, new trial, or other \n                trial has been ordered shall not be the basis for an \n                approved sentence in excess of or more severe than the \n                sentence ultimately approved by the convening or higher \n                authority following the previous trial or hearing, \n                unless the sentence prescribed for the offense is \n                mandatory. When a rehearing or sentencing is combined \n                with trial on new charges, the maximum punishment that \n                may be approved by the convening authority shall be the \n                maximum punishment under R.C.M. 1003 for the offenses \n                being reheard as limited above, plus the total maximum \n                punishment under R.C.M. 1003 for any new charges of \n                which the accused has been found guilty. In the case of \n                an ``other trial'' no sentence limitations apply if the \n                original trial was invalid because a summary or special \n                court-martial improperly tried an offense involving a \n                mandatory punishment or one otherwise considered \n                capital.\n                      (2) Pretrial agreement. If, after the earlier \n                court-martial, the sentence was approved in accordance \n                with a pretrial agreement and at the rehearing the \n                accused fails to comply with the pretrial agreement, by \n                failing to enter a plea of guilty or otherwise, the \n                approved sentence resulting at a rehearing of the \n                affected charges and specifications may include any \n                otherwise lawful [[Page 26648]] punishment not in \n                excess of or more serious than lawfully adjudged at the \n                earlier court-martial.''\n\n                b. R.C.M. 924(a) is amended to read as follows:\n\n                    ``(a) Time for reconsideration. Members may \n                reconsider any finding reached by them before such \n                finding is announced in open session.''\n\n                c. R.C.M. 924(c) is amended to read as follows:\n\n                    ``(c) Military judge sitting alone. In a trial by \n                military judge alone, the military judge may reconsider \n                any finding of guilty at any time before announcement \n                of sentence and may reconsider the issue of the finding \n                of guilty of the elements in a finding of not guilty \n                only by reason of lack of mental responsibility at any \n                time before announcement of sentence or authentication \n                of the record of trial in the case of a complete \n                acquittal.''\n\n                d.

R.C.M. 1003(b)(10), (11), and (12) are redesignated \n                as subsections (9), (10), and (11), respectively.\n\n                f. R.C.M. 1009 is amended to read as follows:\n\n                    ``(a) Reconsideration. Subject to this rule, a \n                sentence may be reconsidered at any time before such \n                sentence is announced in open session of the court.\n                    (b) Exceptions.\n                      (1) If the sentence announced in open session was \n                less than the mandatory minimum prescribed for an \n                offense of which the accused has been found guilty, the \n                court that announced the sentence may reconsider such \n                sentence after it has been announced, and may increase \n                the sentence upon reconsideration in accordance with \n                subsection (e) of this rule.\n                      (2) If the sentence announced in open session \n                exceeds the maximum permissible punishment for the \n                offense or the jurisdictional limitation of the court-\n                martial, the sentence may be reconsidered after \n                announcement in accordance with subsection (e) of this \n                rule.\n                    (c) Clarification of sentence. A sentence may be \n                clarified at any time prior to action of the convening \n                authority on the case.\n                      (1) Sentence adjudged by the military judge. When \n                a sentence adjudged by the military judge is ambiguous, \n                the military judge shall call a session for \n                clarification as soon as practical after the ambiguity \n                is discovered.\n                      (2) Sentence adjudged by members. When a sentence \n                adjudged by members is ambiguous, the military judge \n                shall bring the matter to the attention of the members \n                if the matter is discovered before the court-martial is \n                adjourned. If the matter is discovered after \n                adjournment, the military judge may call a session for \n                clarification by the members who adjudged the sentence \n                as soon as practical after the ambiguity is discovered.\n                    (d) Action by the convening authority. When a \n                sentence adjudged by the court-martial is ambiguous, \n                the convening authority may return the matter to the \n                court-martial for clarification. When a sentence \n                adjudged by the court-martial is apparently illegal, \n                the convening authority may return the matter to the \n                court-martial for reconsideration or may approve a \n                sentence no more severe than the legal, unambiguous \n                portions of the adjudged sentence.\n                    (e) Reconsideration procedure. Any member of the \n                court-martial may propose that a sentence reached by \n                the members be reconsidered.\n                      (1) Instructions. When a sentence has been \n                reached by members and reconsideration has been \n                initiated, the military judge shall instruct the \n                members on the procedure for reconsideration.\n                      (2) Voting. The members shall vote by secret \n                written ballot in closed session whether to reconsider \n                a sentence already reached by them.\n                      (3) Number of votes required.

If the \n                military judge makes a determination under this \n                subsection that the information is subject to \n                disclosure, or if the Government elects not to contest \n                the relevance, necessity, and admissibility of the \n                government information, the Government may proffer a \n                statement admitting for purposes of the court-martial \n                any relevant facts such information would tend to prove \n                or may submit a portion or summary to be used in lieu \n                of the information. The military judge shall order that \n                such statement, portion, summary, or some other form of \n                information which the military judge finds to be \n                consistent with the interests of justice, be used by \n                the accused in place of the government information, \n                unless the military judge finds that use of the \n                government information itself is necessary to afford \n                the accused a fair trial.\n                      (F) Sanctions. Government information may not be \n                disclosed over the Government's objection. If the \n                Government continues to object to disclosure of the \n                information following rulings by the military judge, \n                the military judge shall issue any order that the \n                interests of justice require. Such an order may \n                include:\n                      (i) striking or precluding all or part of the \n                testimony of a witness;\n                      (ii) declaring a mistrial;\n                      (iii) finding against the Government on any issue \n                as to which the evidence is relevant and necessary to \n                the defense;\n                      (iv) dismissing the charges, with or without \n                prejudice; or\n                      (v) dismissing the charges or specifications or \n                both to which the information relates.''\n\n                e. A new M.R.E. 506(j) is added as follows:\n\n                    ``(j) Appeals of orders and rulings. In a court-\n                martial in which a punitive discharge may be adjudged, \n                the Government may appeal an order or ruling \n                [[Page 26653]] of the military judge that terminates \n                the proceedings with respect to a charge or \n                specification, directs the disclosure of government \n                information, or imposes sanctions for nondisclosure of \n                government information. The Government also may appeal \n                an order or ruling in which the military judge refuses \n                to issue a protective order sought by the United States \n                to prevent the disclosure of government information, or \n                to enforce such an order previously issued by \n                appropriate authority. The Government may not appeal an \n                order or ruling that is, or amounts to, a finding of \n                not guilty with respect to the charge or \n                specification.''\n\n                f. M.R.E. 506(j) and (k) are redesignated as (k) and \n                (l), respectively.\n\n                Sec. 4. Part IV of the Manual for Courts-Martial, \n                United States, 1984, is amended to read as follows:\n\n                a. Paragraph 4.c. is amended by adding a new \n                subparagraph (4) as follows:\n\n                    ``(4) Voluntary abandonment. It is a defense to an \n                attempt offense that the person voluntarily and \n                completely abandoned the intended crime, solely because \n                of the person's own sense that it was wrong, prior to \n                the completion of the crime. The voluntary abandonment \n                defense is not allowed if the abandonment results, in \n                whole or in part, from other reasons, such as, the \n                person feared detection or apprehension, decided to \n                await a better opportunity for success, was unable to \n                complete the crime, or encountered unanticipated \n                difficulties or unexpected resistance. A person who is \n                entitled to the defense of voluntary abandonment may \n                nonetheless be guilty of a lesser included, completed \n                offense. For example, a person who voluntarily \n                abandoned an attempted armed robbery may nonetheless be \n                guilty of assault with a dangerous weapon.''\n\n                b. Paragraph 4.c.(4), (5), and (6) are redesignated as \n                subparagraphs (5), (6) and (7), respectively.\n\n                c. Paragraph 30a.c(1), is amended to read as follows:\n\n                    ``(1) Intent. ``Intent or reason to believe'' that \n                the information ``is to be used to the injury of the \n                United States or to the advantage of a foreign nation'' \n                means that the accused acted in bad faith and [delete \n                ``or otherwise''] without lawful authority with respect \n                to information that is not lawfully accessible to the \n                public.''\n\n                d. Paragraph 35 is amended to read as follows:\n\n                    ``35. Article 111--Drunken or reckless operation of \n                a vehicle, aircraft, or vessel\n                      a. Text.\n                      ``Any person subject to this chapter who--\n                      (1) operates or physically controls any vehicle, \n                aircraft, or vessel in a reckless or wanton manner or \n                while impaired by a substance described in section \n                912a(b) of this title (Article 112a(b)), or\n                      (2) operates or is in actual physical control of \n                any vehicle, aircraft, or vessel while drunk or when \n                the alcohol concentration in the person's blood or \n                breath is 0.10 grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of \n                blood or 0.10 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of \n                breath, as shown by chemical analysis, shall be \n                punished as a court-martial may direct.''\n                      b. Elements.\n                      (1) That the accused was operating or in physical \n                control of a vehicle, aircraft, or vessel; and\n                      (2) That while operating or in physical control \n                of a vehicle, aircraft, or vessel, the accused:\n                      (a) did so in a wanton or reckless manner, or\n                      (b) was drunk or impaired, or\n                      (c) the alcohol concentration in the accused's \n                blood or breath was 0.10 grams of alcohol per 100 \n                milliliters of blood or 0.10 grams of alcohol per 210 \n                liters of breath, or greater, as shown by chemical \n                analysis. [[Page 26654]] \n                      [Note: If injury resulted add the following \n                element]\n                      (3) That the accused thereby caused the vehicle, \n                aircraft, or vessel to injure a person.\n                      c. Explanation.\n                      (1) Vehicle. See 1 U.S.C. Sec. 4.\n                      (2) Vessel. See 1 U.S.C. Sec. 3.\n                      (3) Aircraft. Any contrivance used or designed \n                for transportation in the air.\n                      (4) Operates. Operating a vehicle, aircraft, or \n                vessel includes not only driving or guiding a vehicle, \n                aircraft, or vessel while it is in motion, either in \n                person or through the agency of another, but also \n                setting of its motive power in action or the \n                manipulation of its controls so as to cause the \n                particular vehicle, aircraft, or vessel to move.\n                      (5) Physical control and actual physical control. \n                These terms as used in the statute are synonymous. They \n                describe the present capability and power to dominate, \n                direct, or regulate the vehicle, vessel, or aircraft, \n                either in person or through the agency of another, \n                regardless of whether such vehicle, aircraft, or vessel \n                is operated. For example, the intoxicated person seated \n                behind the steering wheel of a vehicle with the keys of \n                the vehicle in or near the ignition but with the engine \n                not turned on could be deemed in actual physical \n                control of that vehicle. However, the person asleep in \n                the back seat with the keys in his or her pocket would \n                not be deemed in actual physical control. Physical \n                control necessarily encompasses operation.\n                      (6) Drunk or impaired. ``Drunk'' and ``impaired'' \n                mean any intoxication which is sufficient to impair the \n                rational and full exercise of the mental or physical \n                faculties. The term ``drunk'' is used in relation to \n                intoxication by alcohol. The term ``impaired'' is used \n                in relation to intoxication by a substance described in \n                Article 112(a), Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n                      (7) Reckless. The operation or physical control \n                of a vehicle, vessel, or aircraft is ``reckless'' when \n                it exhibits a culpable disregard of foreseeable \n                consequences to others from the act or omission \n                involved. Recklessness is not determined solely by \n                reason of the happening of an injury, or the invasion \n                of the rights of another, nor by proof alone of \n                excessive speed or erratic operation, but all these \n                factors may be admissible and relevant as bearing upon \n                the ultimate question: whether, under all the \n                circumstances, the accused's manner of operation or \n                physical control of the vehicle, vessel, or aircraft \n                was of that heedless nature which made it actually or \n                imminently dangerous to the occupants, or to the rights \n                or safety of others. It is operating or physically \n                controlling a vehicle, vessel, or aircraft with such a \n                high degree of negligence that if death were caused, \n                the accused would have committed involuntary \n                manslaughter, at least. The nature of the conditions in \n                which the vehicle, vessel, or aircraft is operated or \n                controlled, the time of day or night, the proximity and \n                number of other vehicles, vessels, or aircraft, and the \n                condition of the vehicle, vessel, or aircraft, are \n                often matters of importance in the proof of an offense \n                charged under this article and, where they are of \n                importance, may properly be alleged.\n                      (8) Wanton. ``Wanton'' includes ``reckless'', but \n                in describing the operation or physical control of a \n                vehicle, vessel, or aircraft, ``wanton'' may, in a \n                proper case, connote willfulness, or a disregard of \n                probable consequences, and thus describe a more \n                aggravated offense.\n                      (9) Causation. The accused's drunken or reckless \n                driving must be a proximate cause of injury for the \n                accused to be guilty of drunken or reckless driving \n                resulting in personal injury. To be proximate, the \n                accused's actions need not be the sole cause of the \n                injury, nor must they be the immediate cause of the \n                injury; that is, the latest in time and space preceding \n                the injury. A contributing cause is deemed proximate \n                only if it plays a material role in the victim's \n                injury. [[Page 26655]] \n                      (10) Separate offenses. While the same course of \n                conduct may constitute violations of both subsections \n                (1) and (2) of the Article, (e.g., both drunken and \n                reckless operation or physical control), this article \n                proscribes the conduct described in both subsections as \n                separate offenses, which may be charged separately. \n                However, as recklessness is a relative matter, evidence \n                of all the surrounding circumstances that made the \n                operation dangerous, whether alleged or not, may be \n                admissible. Thus, on a charge of reckless driving, for \n                example, evidence of drunkenness might be admissible as \n                establishing one aspect of the recklessness, and \n                evidence that the vehicle exceeded a safe speed, at a \n                relevant prior point and time, might be admissible as \n                corroborating other evidence of the specific \n                recklessness charged. Similarly, on a charge of drunken \n                driving, relevant evidence of recklessness might have \n                probative value as corroborating other proof of \n                drunkenness.\n                      d. Lesser included offense.\n                      (1) Reckless or wanton or impaired operation or \n                physical control of a vessel. Article 110--improper \n                hazarding of a vessel.\n                      (2) Drunken operation of a vehicle, vessel, or \n                aircraft while drunk or with a blood or breath alcohol \n                concentration in violation of the described per se \n                standard.\n                      (a) Article 110--improper hazarding of a vessel\n                      (b) Article 112--drunk on duty\n                      (c) Article 134--drunk on station\n                      e. Maximum punishment.\n                      (1) Resulting in personal injury. Dishonorable \n                discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and \n                confinement for 18 months.\n                      (2) No personal injury involved. Bad-conduct \n                discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and \n                confinement for 6 months.\n                      f.

Paragraph 43.b.(3)(c) is amended to read as follows:\n\n                    ``(c) That this act was inherently dangerous to \n                another and showed a wanton disregard for human life;''\n\n                g. Paragraph 43.c.(4)(a) is amended to read as follows:\n\n                    ``(a) Wanton disregard for human life. \n                Intentionally engaging in an act inherently dangerous \n                to another--although without an intent to cause the \n                death of or great bodily harm to any particular person, \n                or even with a wish that death will not be caused--may \n                also constitute murder if the [[Page 26656]] act shows \n                wanton disregard of human life. Such disregard is \n                characterized by heedlessness of the probable \n                consequences of the act or omission, or indifference to \n                the likelihood of death or great bodily harm.

Paragraph 45.c.(1)(a) and (b) are amended as \n                follows:\n\n                    ``(a) Nature of offense. Rape is sexual intercourse \n                by a person, executed by force and without consent of \n                the victim. It may be committed on a victim of any age. \n                Any penetration, however slight, is sufficient to \n                complete the offense.\n                    (b) Force and lack of consent. Force and lack of \n                consent are necessary to the offense. Thus, if the \n                victim consents to the act, it is not rape. The lack of \n                consent required, however, is more than mere lack of \n                acquiescence. If a victim in possession of his or her \n                mental faculties fails to make lack of consent \n                reasonably manifest by taking such measures of \n                resistance as are called for by the circumstances, the \n                inference may be drawn that the victim did consent. \n                Consent, however, may not be inferred if resistance \n                would have been futile, where resistance is overcome by \n                threats of death or great bodily harm, or where the \n                victim is unable to resist because of the lack of \n                mental or physical faculties. In such a case there is \n                no consent and the force involved in penetration will \n                suffice. All the surrounding circumstances are to be \n                considered in determining whether a victim gave \n                consent, or whether he or she failed or ceased to \n                resist only because of a reasonable fear of death or \n                grievous bodily harm. If there is actual consent, \n                although obtained by fraud, the act is not rape, but if \n                to the accused's knowledge the victim is of unsound \n                mind or unconscious to an extent rendering him or her \n                incapable of giving consent, the act is rape. Likewise, \n                the acquiescence of a child of such tender years that \n                he or she is incapable of understanding the nature of \n                the act is not consent.''\n\n                k. Paragraph 89.c. is amended to read as follows:\n\n                    ``(c) Explanation. ``Indecent'' language is that \n                which is grossly offensive to modesty, decency, or \n                propriety, or shocks the moral sense, because of its \n                vulgar, filthy, or disgusting nature, or its tendency \n                to incite lustful thought. Language is indecent if it \n                tends reasonably to corrupt morals or incite libidinous \n                thoughts. The language must violate community \n                standards. See paragraph 87 if the communication was \n                made in the physical presence of a child.''\n\n                l. The following new paragraph is added after paragraph \n                103:\n\n                    ``103a.

Elements.\n                      (1) That the accused intentionally inflicted \n                injury upon himself or herself;\n                      (2) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of \n                the accused was to the prejudice of good order and \n                discipline in the armed forces or was of a nature to \n                bring discredit upon the armed forces.\n                      [Note: If the offense was committed in time of \n                war or in a hostile fire pay zone, add the following \n                element]\n                      (3) That the offense was committed (in time of \n                war) (in a hostile fire pay zone). [[Page 26657]] \n                    c. Explanation.\n                      (1) Nature of offense. This offense differs from \n                malingering (see paragraph 40) in that for this \n                offense, the accused need not have harbored a design to \n                avoid performance of any work, duty, or service which \n                may properly or normally be expected of one in the \n                military service. This offense is characterized by \n                intentional self-injury under such circumstances as \n                prejudice good order and discipline or discredit the \n                armed forces. It is not required that the accused be \n                unable to perform duties, or that the accused actually \n                be absent from his or her place of duty as a result of \n                the injury. For example, the accused may inflict the \n                injury while on leave or pass. The circumstances and \n                extent of injury, however, are relevant to a \n                determination that the accused's conduct was \n                prejudicial to good order and discipline, or service-\n                discrediting.\n                      (2) How injury inflicted. The injury may be \n                inflicted by nonviolent as well as by violent means and \n                may be accomplished by any act or omission that \n                produces, prolongs, or aggravates a sickness or \n                disability. Thus, voluntary starvation that results in \n                a debility is a self-inflicted injury. Similarly, the \n                injury may be inflicted by another at the accused's \n                request.\n                    d. Lesser included offense.

The \n                maximum punishment for subsection (1) reflects the \n                serious effect that this offense may have on readiness \n                and morale. The maximum punishment reflects the range \n                of the effects of the injury, both in degree and \n                duration, on the ability of the accused to perform \n                work, duty, or service. The maximum punishment for \n                subsection (1) is equivalent to that for offenses of \n                desertion, missing movement through design, and certain \n                violations of orders. The maximum punishment for \n                subsection (2) is less than the maximum punishment for \n                the offense of malingering under the same circumstances \n                because of the absence of the specific intent to avoid \n                work, duty, or service. The maximum punishment for \n                subsection (2) is equivalent to that for nonaggravated \n                offenses of desertion, willfully disobeying a superior \n                commissioned officer, and nonaggravated malingering by \n                intentional self-inflicted injury.\n                      f.

The amended procedures provide for \n                full disclosure of the government information in \n                question to the accused for purposes of litigating the \n                admissibility of the information in the protected \n                environment of the in camera proceeding; i.e., the \n                Article 39(a) session is closed to the public and \n                neither side may disclose the information outside the \n                in camera proceeding until the military judge admits \n                the information as evidence in the trial.

The rule enunciated in \n                Solorio v.

When mitigating \n                confinement or hard labor without confinement, the \n                convening authority should use the equivalencies at \n                R.C.M. 1003(b)(6) and (7), as appropriate.

See subsection \n                (2) below for additional limits on enlisted persons \n                serving in pay grades above the fourth enlisted pay \n                grade.\n                    A summary court-martial may not suspend all or part \n                of a sentence, although the summary court-martial may \n                recommend to the convening au [[Page 26666]] thority \n                that all or part of a sentence be suspended. If a \n                sentence includes both reduction in grade and \n                forfeitures, the maximum forfeiture is calculated at \n                the reduced pay grade.

These critical infrastructures \n                include telecommunications, electrical power systems, \n                gas and oil storage and transportation, banking and \n                finance, transportation, water supply systems, \n                emergency services (including medical, police, fire, \n                and rescue), and continuity of government. Threats to \n                these critical infrastructures fall into two \n                categories: physical threats to tangible property \n                (``physical threats''), and threats of electronic, \n                radio-frequency, or computer-based attacks on the \n                information or communications components that control \n                critical infrastructures (``cyber threats''). Because \n                many of these critical infrastructures are owned and \n                operated by the private sector, it is essential that \n                the government and private sector work together to \n                develop a strategy for protecting them and assuring \n                their continued operation.\n\n                NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as \n                President by the Constitution and the laws of the \n                United States of America, it is hereby ordered as \n                follows:\n\n                Section 1. Establishment. There is hereby established \n                the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure \n                Protection (``Commission'').\n\n                    (a) Chair. A qualified individual from outside the \n                Federal Government shall be appointed by the President \n                to serve as Chair of the Commission. The Commission \n                Chair shall be employed on a full-time basis.\n                    (b) Members. The head of each of the following \n                executive branch departments and agencies shall \n                nominate not more than two full-time members of the \n                Commission:\n                    (i) Department of the Treasury;\n                    (ii) Department of Justice;\n                    (iii) Department of Defense;\n                    (iv) Department of Commerce;\n                    (v) Department of Transportation;\n                    (vi) Department of Energy;\n                    (vii) Central Intelligence Agency;\n                    (viii) Federal Emergency Management Agency;\n                    (ix) Federal Bureau of Investigation;\n                    (x) National Security Agency.\n\n                One of the nominees of each agency may be an individual \n                from outside the Federal Government who shall be \n                employed by the agency on a full-time basis. Each \n                nominee must be approved by the Steering Committee.\n\n                Sec. 2. The Principals Committee. The Commission shall \n                report to the President through a Principals Committee \n                (``Principals Committee''), which shall review any \n                reports or recommendations before submission to the \n                President.

The Steering Committee of the President's \n                Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection. A \n                Steering Committee (``Steering Committee'') shall \n                oversee the work of the Commission on behalf of the \n                Principals Committee. The Steering Committee shall \n                comprise four members appointed by the President. One \n                of the members shall be the Chair of the Commission and \n                one shall be an employee of the Executive Office of the \n                President. The Steering Committee will receive regular \n                reports on the progress of the Commission's work and \n                approve the submission of reports to the Principals \n                Committee.\n\n                Sec. 4. Mission. The Commission shall: (a) within 30 \n                days of this order, produce a statement of its mission \n                objectives, which will elaborate the general objectives \n                set forth in this order, and a detailed schedule for \n                addressing each mission objective, for approval by the \n                Steering Committee;\n\n                    (b) identify and consult with: (i) elements of the \n                public and private sectors that conduct, support, or \n                contribute to infrastructure assurance; (ii) owners and \n                operators of the critical infrastructures; and (iii) \n                other elements of the public and private sectors, \n                including the Congress, that have an interest in \n                critical infrastructure assurance issues and that may \n                have differing perspectives on these issues;\n                    (c) assess the scope and nature of the \n                vulnerabilities of, and threats to, critical \n                infrastructures;\n                    (d) determine what legal and policy issues are \n                raised by efforts to protect critical infrastructures \n                and assess how these issues should be addressed;\n                    (e) recommend a comprehensive national policy and \n                implementation strategy for protecting critical \n                infrastructures from physical and cyber threats and \n                assuring their continued operation;\n                    (f) propose any statutory or regulatory changes \n                necessary to effect its recommendations; and\n                    (g) produce reports and recommendations to the \n                Steering Committee as they become available; it shall \n                not limit itself to producing one final report.\n\n                Sec. 5. Advisory Committee to the President's \n                Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection. (a) \n                The Commission shall receive advice from an advisory \n                committee (``Advisory Committee'') composed of no more \n                than ten individuals appointed by the President from \n                the private sector who are knowledgeable about critical \n                infrastructures. The Advisory Committee shall advise \n                the Commission on the subjects of the Commission's \n                mission in whatever manner the Advisory Committee, the \n                Commission Chair, and the Steering Committee deem \n                appropriate.\n\n                    (b) A Chair shall be designated by the President \n                from among the members of the Advisory Committee.\n                    (c) The Advisory Committee shall be established in \n                compliance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as \n                amended (5 U.S.C.

In addition, at the \n                Commission's request, executive departments and \n                agencies shall request that existing Federal advisory \n                committees consider and provide advice on issues of \n                critical infrastructure protection, to the extent \n                permitted by law.\n                    (f) The Commission, the Principals Committee, the \n                Steering Committee, and the Advisory Committee shall \n                terminate 1 year from the date of this order, unless \n                extended by the President prior to that date.\n\n                Sec. 7. Interim Coordinating Mission. (a) While the \n                Commission is conducting its analysis and until the \n                President has an opportunity to consider and act on its \n                recommendations, there is a need to increase \n                coordination of existing infrastructure protection \n                efforts in order to better address, and prevent, crises \n                that would have a debilitating regional or national \n                impact. There is hereby established an Infrastructure \n                Protection Task Force (``IPTF'') within the Department \n                of Justice, chaired by the Federal Bureau of \n                Investigation, to undertake this interim coordinating \n                mission.\n\n                    (b) The IPTF will not supplant any existing \n                programs or organizations.\n                    (c) The Steering Committee shall oversee the work \n                of the IPTF.\n                    (d) The IPTF shall include at least one full-time \n                member each from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, \n                the Department of Defense, and the National Security \n                Agency. It shall also receive part-time assistance from \n                other executive branch departments and agencies. \n                Members shall be designated by their departments or \n                agencies on the basis of their expertise in the \n                protection of critical infrastructures.

Protection of Educationally Useful Federal \n                Equipment. (a) Educationally useful Federal equipment \n                is a vital national resource. To the extent such \n                equipment can be used as is, separated into parts for \n                other computers, or upgraded--either by professional \n                technicians, students, or other recycling efforts--\n                educationally useful Federal equipment is a valuable \n                tool for computer education. Therefore, to the extent \n                possible, all executive departments and agencies \n                (hereinafter referred to as ``agencies'') shall protect \n                and safeguard such equipment, particularly when \n                declared excess or surplus, so that it may be recycled \n                and transferred, if appropriate, pursuant to this \n                order.\n\n                Sec. 2.

(a) To the extent permitted by law, all \n                agencies shall give highest preference to schools and \n                nonprofit organizations, including community-based \n                educational organizations, (``schools and nonprofit \n                organizations'') in the transfer, through gift or \n                donation, of educationally useful Federal equipment.\n\n                    (b) Agencies shall attempt to give particular \n                preference to schools and nonprofit organizations \n                located in the Federal enterprise communities and \n                empowerment zones established in the Omnibus \n                Reconciliation Act of 1993, Public Law 103-66.\n                    (c) Each agency shall, to the extent permitted by \n                law and where appropriate, identify educationally \n                useful Federal equipment that it no longer needs and \n                transfer it to a school or nonprofit organization by:\n                      (1) conveying research equipment directly to the \n                school or organization pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 3710(i); \n                or\n                      (2) reporting excess equipment to the General \n                Services Administration (GSA) for donation when \n                declared surplus in accordance with section 203(j) of \n                the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of \n                1949, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 484(j). Agencies shall \n                report such equipment as far as possible\n\n[[Page 17228]]\n\n                in advance of the date the equipment becomes excess, so \n                that GSA may attempt to arrange direct transfers from \n                the donating agency to recipients eligible under this \n                order.\n                    (d) In transfers made pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) \n                of this section, title shall transfer directly from the \n                agency to the schools or nonprofit organizations as \n                required by 15 U.S.C. 3710(i). All such transfers shall \n                be reported to the GSA. At the direction of the \n                recipient institution or organization, and if \n                appropriate, transferred equipment may be conveyed \n                initially to a nonprofit reuse or recycling program \n                that will upgrade it before transfer to the school or \n                nonprofit organization holding title.\n                    (e) All transfers to schools or nonprofit \n                organizations, whether made directly or through GSA, \n                shall be made at the lowest cost to the school or \n                nonprofit organization permitted by law.\n                    (f) The availability of educationally useful \n                Federal equipment shall be made known to eligible \n                recipients under this order by all practicable means, \n                including newspaper, community announcements, and the \n                Internet.\n                    (g) The regional Federal Executive Boards shall \n                help facilitate the transfer of educationally useful \n                Federal equipment from the agencies they represent to \n                recipients eligible under this order.\n\n                Sec. 3.

(a) Each agency that has \n                employees who have computer expertise shall, to the \n                extent permitted by law and in accordance with the \n                guidelines of the Office of Personnel Management, \n                encourage those employees to:\n\n                      (1) help connect America's classrooms to the \n                National Information Infrastructure;\n                      (2) assist teachers in learning to use computers \n                to teach; and\n                      (3) provide ongoing maintenance of and technical \n                support for the educationally useful Federal equipment \n                transferred pursuant to this order.\n                    (b) Each agency described in subsection (a) shall \n                submit to the Office of Science and Technology Policy, \n                within 6 months of the date of this order, an \n                implementation plan to advance the developments \n                described in this order, particularly those required in \n                this section. The plan shall be consistent with \n                approved agency budget totals and shall be coordinated \n                through the Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n                    (c) Nothing in this order shall be interpreted to \n                bar a recipient of educationally useful Federal \n                equipment from lending that equipment, whether on a \n                permanent or temporary basis, to a teacher, \n                administrator, student, employee, or other designated \n                person in furtherance of educational goals.\n\n                Sec. 4.

The mission of the National Wildlife Refuge \n                System (``Refuge System'') is to preserve a national \n                network of lands and waters for the conservation and \n                management of fish, wildlife, and plant resources of \n                the United States for the benefit of present and future \n                generations.\n\n                Sec. 2. Guiding Principles. To help ensure a bright \n                future for its treasured national heritage, I hereby \n                affirm the following four guiding principles for the \n                management and general public use of the Refuge System:\n\n                    (a) Public Use. The Refuge System provides \n                important opportunities for compatible wildlife-\n                dependent recreational activities involving hunting, \n                fishing, wildlife observation and photography, and \n                environmental education and interpretation.\n                    (b) Habitat. Fish and wildlife will not prosper \n                without high-quality habitat, and without fish and \n                wildlife, traditional uses of refuges cannot be \n                sustained. The Refuge System will continue to conserve \n                and enhance the quality and diversity of fish and \n                wildlife habitat within refuges.\n                    (c) Partnerships. America's sportsmen and women \n                were the first partners who insisted on protecting \n                valuable wildlife habitat within wildlife refuges. \n                Conservation partnerships with other Federal agencies, \n                State agencies, Tribes, organizations, industry, and \n                the general public can make significant contributions \n                to the growth and management of the Refuge System.\n                    (d) Public Involvement. The public should be given \n                a full and open opportunity to participate in decisions \n                regarding acquisition and management of our National \n                Wildlife Refuges.\n\n                Sec. 3. Directives to the Secretary of the Interior. To \n                the extent consistent with existing laws and \n                interagency agreements, the Secretary of the Interior, \n                in carrying out his trustee and stewardship \n                responsibilities for the Refuge System, is directed to:\n\n                    (a) recognize compatible wildlife-dependent \n                recreational activities involving hunting, fishing, \n                wildlife observation and photography, and environmental \n                education and interpretation as priority general public \n                uses of the Refuge System through which the American \n                public can develop an appreciation for fish and \n                wildlife;\n                    (b) provide expanded opportunities for these \n                priority public uses within the Refuge System when they \n                are compatible and consistent with sound principles of \n                fish and wildlife management, and are otherwise in the \n                public interest;\n                \n[[Page 13648]]\n\n                    (c) ensure that such priority public uses receive \n                enhanced attention in planning and management within \n                the Refuge System;\n                    (d) provide increased opportunities for families to \n                experience wildlife-dependent recreation, particularly \n                opportunities for parents and their children to safely \n                engage in traditional outdoor activities, such as \n                fishing and hunting;\n                    (e) ensure that the biological integrity and \n                environmental health of the Refuge System is maintained \n                for the benefit of present and future generations of \n                Americans;\n                    (f) continue, consistent with existing laws and \n                interagency agreements, authorized or permitted uses of \n                units of the Refuge System by other Federal agencies, \n                including those necessary to facilitate military \n                preparedness;\n                    (g) plan and direct the continued growth of the \n                Refuge System in a manner that is best designed to \n                accomplish the mission of the Refuge System, to \n                contribute to the conservation of the ecosystems of the \n                United States, and to increase support for the Refuge \n                System and participation from conservation partners and \n                the public;\n                    (h) ensure timely and effective cooperation and \n                collaboration with Federal agencies and State fish and \n                wildlife agencies during the course of acquiring and \n                managing National Wildlife Refuges;\n                    (i) ensure appropriate public involvement \n                opportunities will be provided in conjunction with \n                refuge planning and management activities; and\n                    (j) identify, prior to acquisition, existing \n                compatible wildlife-dependent uses of new refuge lands \n                that shall be permitted to continue on an interim basis \n                pending completion of comprehensive planning.\n\n                Sec. 4. Judicial Review. This order does not create any \n                right or benefit, substantive or procedural, \n                enforceable at law or equity by a party against the \n                United States, its agencies, its officers, or any \n                person.\n\n                    (Presidential Sig.)<clinton1><clinton2>\n\n                THE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n                    March 25, 1996.\n\n[FR Doc. 96-7774\nFiled 3-27-96; 8:45 am]\nBilling code 3195-01-P\n\n</clinton2></clinton1></pre>]","url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/1996/03/28/96-7774/management-and-general-public-use-of-the-national-wildlife-refuge-system","president":"clinton","id":"12996"},"reftime":1418257585931}

Statement of Policy. Through the \n                Administration's community empowerment initiatives, the \n                Federal Government has undertaken various efforts to \n                revitalize our central cities, which have historically \n                served as the centers for growth and commerce in our \n                metropolitan areas. Accordingly, the Administration \n                hereby reaffirms the commitment set forth in Executive \n                Order No. 12072 to strengthen our Nation's cities by \n                encouraging the location of Federal facilities in our \n                central cities. The Administration also reaffirms the \n                commitments set forth in the National Historic \n                Preservation Act to provide leadership in the \n                preservation of historic resources, and in the Public \n                Buildings Cooperative Use Act of 1976 to acquire and \n                utilize space in suitable buildings of historic, \n                architectural, or cultural significance.\n\n                 To this end, the Federal Government shall utilize and \n                maintain, wherever operationally appropriate and \n                economically prudent, historic properties and \n                districts, especially those located in our central \n                business areas. When implementing these policies, the \n                Federal Government shall institute practices and \n                procedures that are sensible, understandable, and \n                compatible with current authority and that impose the \n                least burden on, and provide the maximum benefit to, \n                society.\n\n                 Sec. 2. Encouraging the Location of Federal Facilities \n                on Historic Properties in Our Central Cities. When \n                operationally appropriate and economically prudent, and \n                subject to the requirements of section 601 of title VI \n                of the Rural Development Act of 1972, as amended (42 \n                U.S.C. 3122), and Executive Order No. 12072, when \n                locating Federal facilities, Federal agencies shall \n                give first consideration to historic properties within \n                historic districts. If no such property is suitable, \n                then Federal agencies shall consider other developed or \n                undeveloped sites within historic districts. Federal \n                agencies shall then consider historic properties \n                outside of historic districts, if no suitable site \n                within a district exists. Any rehabilitation or \n                construction that is undertaken pursuant to this order \n                must be architecturally compatible with the character \n                of the surrounding historic district or properties.\n\n                 Sec. 3. Identifying and Removing Regulatory Barriers. \n                Federal agencies with responsibilities for leasing, \n                acquiring, locating, maintaining, or managing Federal \n                facilities or with responsibilities for the planning \n                for, or managing of, historic resources shall take \n                steps to reform, streamline, and otherwise minimize \n                regulations, policies, and procedures that impede the \n                Federal Government's ability to establish or maintain a \n                presence in historic districts or to acquire historic \n                properties to satisfy Federal space needs, unless such \n                regulations, policies, and procedures are designed to \n                protect human health and safety or the environment. \n                Federal agencies are encouraged to seek the assistance \n                of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation when \n                taking these steps.\n\n[[Page 26072]]\n\n                 Sec. 4. Improving Preservation Partnerships. In \n                carrying out the authorities of the National Historic \n                Preservation Act, the Secretary of the Interior, the \n                Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and each \n                Federal agency shall seek appropriate partnerships with \n                States, local governments, Indian tribes, and \n                appropriate private organizations with the goal of \n                enhancing participation of these parties in the \n                National Historic Preservation Program. Such \n                partnerships should embody the principles of \n                administrative flexibility, reduced paperwork, and \n                increased service to the public.\n\n                 Sec. 5.

One \n                group dedicated to such activities is the President's \n                Council on Management Improvement (PCMI), established \n                by Executive Order 12479 in 1984, reestablished by \n                Executive Order 12816 in 1992.

Since the inception of \n                the TRI program, reported releases to the environment \n                under TRI have decreased significantly.\n\n                The efficiency of the Federal Government is served when \n                it purchases high quality supplies and services that \n                have been produced with a minimum impact on the public \n                health and environment of communities surrounding \n                government contractors. Savings associated with reduced \n                raw materials usage, reduced use of costly, inefficient \n                end-of-pipeline pollution controls, and reduced \n                liability and remediation costs from worker and \n                community claims all serve to increase the economic and \n                efficient provision of essential supplies and services \n                to the government. As a result of TRI reporting, many \n                manufacturers have learned of previously unrecognized \n                significant efficiencies and cost savings in their \n                production processes.\n\n                The Federal Government's receipt of timely and quality \n                supplies and services is also served by the general \n                enhancement of relations between government contractors \n                and the communities in which they are situated, as well \n                as the cooperative working relationship between \n                employers and employees who may be subject to exposure \n                to toxic materials.\n\n                Information concerning chemical release and transfer \n                can assist the government to purchase efficiently \n                produced, lower cost, and higher quality supplies and \n                services that also have a minimum adverse impact on \n                community health and the environment.\n\n                NOW, THEREFORE, to promote economy and efficiency in \n                government procurement of supplies and services, and by \n                the authority vested in me as President by the \n                Constitution and the laws of the United States of \n                America, including EPCRA, 42 U.S.C. 11001 et seq., PPA, \n                42 U.S.C. 13101 et seq., 40 U.S.C. 471 and 486(a), and \n                3 U.S.C. 301, it is hereby ordered as follows:\n\n                Section 1.

For all contracts expected to exceed \n                $500,000, each Federal agency shall consult with the \n                Administrator or the Administrator's designee when the \n                agency believes it is not practicable to include the \n                eligibility requirement of section 3-301 in the \n                contract solicitation or award.\n                    4-404. Each Federal agency shall require each \n                Federal contractor designated in subsection 3-302 above \n                to:\n                (a) Have included in its response to the contract \n                solicitation a certification, as specified in the \n                guidelines published pursuant to subsection 4-401 of \n                this order, that it will (if awarded the contract) \n                comply with the requirements of subsection 3-301; and\n\n                (b) File with the Administrator and each appropriate \n                State pursuant to section 313(a) of EPCRA, 42 U.S.C. \n                11023(a), the information required by subsection 3-301, \n                beginning on the next July 1 after the date on which \n                the contract is awarded.\n\n                    4-405.

The Administrator shall transmit that \n                recommendation to the head of the contracting agency, \n                and that agency shall consider the recommendation and \n                determine whether to terminate the contract. In \n                carrying out this responsibility, the Administrator may \n                investigate any subject Federal contractor to determine \n                the adequacy of compliance with the provisions of this \n                order and the Administrator's designee may hold such \n                hearings, public or private, as the Administrator deems \n                advisable to assist in the Administrator's \n                determination of compliance.\n                    4-407. Each contracting agency shall cooperate with \n                the Administrator and provide such information and \n                assistance as the Administrator may require in the \n                performance of the Administrator's functions under this \n                order.\n                    4-408. Upon request and to the extent practicable, \n                the Administrator shall provide technical advice and \n                assistance to Federal agencies in order to assist in \n                full compliance with this order.\n\n                Sec 5. General Provisions. 5-501. The requirements of \n                this order shall be implemented and incorporated in \n                acquisition regulations, including the Federal \n                Acquisition Regulations (FAR), within 90 days after the \n                effective date of this order.\n\n                    5-502. This order is not intended, and should not \n                be construed, to create any right or benefit, \n                substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a \n                party against the United States, its agencies, it \n                officers, or its employees.

Energy Consumption Reduction Goals. (a) Each \n                agency shall develop and implement a program with the \n                intent of reducing energy consumption by 30 percent by \n                the year 2005, based on energy consumption per-gross-\n                square-foot of its buildings in use, to the extent that \n                these measures are cost-effective. The 30 percent \n                reductions shall be measured relative to the agency's \n                1985 energy use. Each agency's implementation program \n                shall be designed to speed the introduction of cost-\n                effective, energy-efficient technologies into Federal \n                facilities, and to meet the goals and requirements of \n                the Act and this order.\n\n                    (b) Each agency shall develop and implement a \n                program for its industrial facilities in the aggregate \n                with the intent of increasing energy efficiency by at \n                least 20 percent by the year 2005 as compared to the \n                1990 benchmark, to the extent these measures are cost-\n                effective, and shall implement all cost-effective water \n                conservation projects. DOE, in coordination with the \n                656 Committee, shall establish definitions and \n                appropriate indicators of energy and water efficiency, \n                and energy and water consumption and costs, in Federal \n                industrial facilities for the purpose of establishing a \n                base year of 1990.\n\n                Sec. 302. Energy and Water Surveys and Audits of \n                Federal Facilities. (a) Prioritization Survey. Each \n                agency responsible for managing Federal facilities \n                shall conduct a prioritization survey, within 18 months \n                of the date of this order, on each of the facilities \n                the agency manages. The surveys shall be used to \n                establish priorities for conducting comprehensive \n                facility audits.\n\n                    (b) Comprehensive Facility Audits. Each agency \n                shall develop and begin implementing a 10-year plan to \n                conduct or obtain comprehensive facility audits, based \n                on prioritization surveys performed under section \n                302(a) of this order.\n                  (1) Implementation of the plan shall ensure that \n                comprehensive facility audits of approximately 10 \n                percent of the agency's facilities are completed each \n                year. Agencies responsible for managing less than 100 \n                Federal facilities shall plan and execute approximately \n                10 comprehensive facility audits per year until all \n                facilities have been audited.\n                  (2) Comprehensive audits of facilities performed \n                within the last 3 years may be considered current for \n                the purposes of implementation.\n                  (3) ``No-cost'' audits, such as those outlined in \n                section 501(c) of this order, shall be utilized to the \n                extent practicable.\n\n                    (c) Exempt Facilities. Because the mission within \n                facilities exempt from the energy and water reduction \n                requirements under the Act may not allow energy \n                efficiency and water conservation in certain \n                operations, actions shall be taken to reduce all other \n                energy and water waste using the procedures described \n                in the Act and this order. Each agency shall develop \n                and implement a plan to improve energy and water \n                efficiency in such exempt facilities. The \n                prioritization surveys are intended to allow agencies \n                to refine their designation of facilities as ``exempt'' \n                or ``industrial,'' so that only individual buildings in \n                which industrial or energy-intensive operations are \n                conducted remain designated as ``exempt'' or \n                ``industrial.'' Within 21 months of the date of this \n                order, each agency shall report to FEMP and to the \n                Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') the \n                redesignations that the agency is making as a result of \n                the prioritization surveys. Agencies may seek \n                exemptions for their facilities pursuant to the Energy \n                Policy and Conservation Act, as amended.\n                    (d) Leased Facilities. Agencies shall conduct \n                surveys and audits of leased facilities to the extent \n                practicable and to the extent that the recommendations \n                of such surveys and audits could be implemented under \n                the terms of the lease.\n\n                Sec. 303. Implementation of Energy Efficiency and Water \n                Conservation Projects. (a) Implementation of New Audit \n                Recommendations. Within 1 year of the date of this \n                order, agencies shall identify, based on preliminary \n                recommendations from the prioritization surveys \n                required under section 302 of this order, high priority \n                facilities to audit and shall complete the first 10 \n                percent of the required comprehensive facility audits. \n                Within 180 days of the completion of the comprehensive \n                facility audit of each facility, agencies shall begin \n                implementing cost-effective recommendations for \n                installation of energy efficiency, water conservation, \n                and renewable energy technologies for that facility.\n\n                    (b) Implementation of Existing Audits. Within 180 \n                days of the date of this order, agencies shall begin to \n                implement cost-effective recommendations from \n                comprehensive audits of facilities performed within the \n                past 3 years, for installation of energy efficiency, \n                water conservation, and renewable energy technologies.\n\n                Sec. 304. Solar and Other Renewable Energy. The goal of \n                the Federal Government is to significantly increase the \n                use of solar and other renewable energy sources. DOE \n                shall develop a program for achieving this goal cost-\n                effectively and, within 210 days of the date of this \n                order, submit the program to the 656 Committee for \n                review. DOE shall lead the effort to assist agencies in \n                meeting this goal.\n\n                Sec. 305. Minimization of Petroleum-Based Fuel Use in \n                Federal Buildings and Facilities. All agencies shall \n                develop and implement programs to reduce the use of \n                petroleum in their buildings and facilities by \n                switching to a less-polluting and nonpetroleum-based \n                energy source, such as natural gas or solar and other \n                renewable energy sources. Where alternative fuels are \n                not practical or cost-effective, agencies shall strive \n                to improve the efficiency with which they use the \n                petroleum. Each agency shall survey its buildings and \n                facilities that utilize petroleum-based fuel systems to \n                determine where the potential for a dual-fuel \n                capability exists and shall provide dual-fuel \n                capability where cost-effective and practicable.\n\n                Sec. 306. New Space. (a) New Federal Facility \n                Construction. Each agency involved in the construction \n                of a new facility that is to be either owned by or \n                leased to the Federal Government shall:\n\n                  (1) design and construct such facility to minimize \n                the life cycle cost of the facility by utilizing energy \n                efficiency, water conservation, or solar or other \n                renewable energy technologies;\n                  (2) ensure that the design and construction of \n                facilities meet or exceed the energy performance \n                standards applicable to Federal residential or \n                commercial buildings as set forth in 10 CFR 435, local \n                building standards, or a Btu-per-gross-square-foot \n                ceiling as determined by the Task Force within 120 days \n                of the date of this order, whichever will result in a \n                lower life cycle cost over the life of the facility;\n                  (3) establish and implement, within 270 days of the \n                date of this order, a facility commissioning program \n                that will ensure that the construction of such \n                facilities meets the requirements outlined in this \n                section before the facility is accepted into the \n                Federal facility inventory; and\n                  (4) utilize passive solar design and adopt active \n                solar technologies where they are cost-effective.\n\n                    (b) New Leases For Existing Facilities. To the \n                extent practicable and permitted by law, agencies \n                entering into leases, including the renegotiation or \n                extension of existing leases, shall identify the energy \n                and water consumption of those facilities and seek to \n                incorporate provisions into each lease that minimize \n                the cost of energy and water under a life cycle \n                analysis, while maintaining or improving occupant \n                health and safety. These requirements may include \n                renovation of proposed space prior to or within the \n                first year of each lease. Responsible agencies shall \n                seek to negotiate the cost of the lease, taking into \n                account the reduced energy and water costs during the \n                term of the lease.\n                    (c) Government-Owned Contractor-Operated \n                Facilities. All Government-owned contractor-operated \n                facilities shall comply with the goals and requirements \n                of this order.

The studies shall be \n                completed within 270 days of the date of this order. \n                The OFPP will issue guidance to agencies on life cycle \n                value engineering within 6 months of the completion of \n                the studies.\n                    (i) The Secretary of Energy and the Administrator \n                of General Services shall develop and distribute \n                through the Task Force a model building commissioning \n                program within 270 days of the date of this order.\n                    (j) The lists, guidelines, and services in this \n                section of the order shall be updated periodically.\n\n                Sec. 502. Retention of Savings and Rebates. (a) Within \n                a reasonable time after the date of this order, the \n                Director of OMB, along with the Secretary of Energy, \n                the Secretary of Defense, and the Administrator of \n                General Services, to the extent practicable and \n                permitted by law, shall develop guidelines and \n                implement procedures to allow agencies, in fiscal year \n                1995 and beyond, to retain utility rebates and \n                incentives received by the agency and savings from \n                energy efficiency and water conservation efforts as \n                provided in section 152 of the Energy Policy Act of \n                1992 and 10 U.S.C. 2865 and 2866.\n\n                Sec. 503. Performance Evaluations. To recognize the \n                responsibilities of facility managers, designers, \n                energy managers, their superiors, and, to the extent \n                practicable and appropriate, others critical to the \n                implementation of this order, heads of agencies shall \n                include successful implementation of energy efficiency, \n                water conservation, and solar and other renewable \n                energy projects in their position descriptions and \n                performance evaluations.\n\n                Sec. 504. Incentive Awards. Agencies are encouraged to \n                review employee incentive programs to ensure that such \n                programs appropriately reward exceptional performance \n                in implementing the Act and this order. Such awards may \n                include monetary incentives such as Quality Step \n                Increases, leave time awards and productivity \n                gainsharing, and nonmonetary and honor awards such as \n                increased authority, additional resources, and a series \n                of options from which employees or teams of employees \n                can choose.\n\n                Sec. 505. Project Teams/Franchising. (a) Agencies are \n                encouraged to establish Energy Efficiency and \n                Environmental Project Teams (``Project Teams'') to \n                implement energy efficiency, water conservation, and \n                solar and other renewable energy projects within their \n                respective agencies. DOE shall develop a program to \n                train and support the Project Teams, which should have \n                particular expertise in innovative financing, including \n                shared energy savings and energy savings performance \n                contracting. The purpose of the program is to enable \n                project teams to implement projects quickly and \n                effectively in their own agencies.\n\n                    (b) Agencies are encouraged to franchise the \n                services of their Project Teams. The ability to access \n                the services of other agencies' teams will foster \n                excellence in project implementation through \n                competition among service providers, while providing an \n                alternative method to meet or exceed the requirements \n                of the Act and this order for agencies that are unable \n                to devote sufficient personnel to implement projects.\n\n                Sec. 506. FEMP Account Managers. FEMP shall develop a \n                customer service program and assign account managers to \n                agencies or regions so that each project may have a \n                designated account manager. When requested by an \n                agency, the account manager shall start at the audit \n                phase and follow a project through commissioning, \n                evaluation, and reporting. The account manager shall \n                provide technical assistance and shall have \n                responsibility to see that all actions possible are \n                taken to ensure success of the project.\n\n                Sec. 507. Procurement of Energy Efficient Products by \n                Federal Agencies. (a) ``Best Practice'' Technologies. \n                Agencies shall purchase energy-efficient products in \n                accordance with the guidelines issued by OMB, in \n                consultation with the Defense Logistics Agency \n                (``DLA''), DOE, and GSA, under section 161 of the \n                Energy Policy Act of 1992. The guidelines shall include \n                listings of energy-efficient products and practices \n                used in the Federal Government. At a minimum, OMB shall \n                update the listings annually. DLA, DOE, and GSA shall \n                update the portions of the listings for which they have \n                responsibility as new products become available and \n                conditions change.\n\n                  (1) Each agency shall purchase products listed as \n                energy-efficient in the guidelines whenever \n                practicable, and whenever they meet the agency's \n                specific performance requirements and are cost-\n                effective. Each agency shall institute mechanisms to \n                set targets and measure progress.\n                  (2) To further encourage a market for highly-energy-\n                efficient products, each agency shall increase, to the \n                extent practicable and cost-effective, purchases of \n                products that are in the upper 25 percent of energy \n                efficiency for all similar products, or products that \n                are at least 10 percent more efficient than the minimum \n                level that meets Federal standards. This requirement \n                shall apply wherever such information is available, \n                either through Federal or industry-approved testing and \n                rating procedures.\n                  (3) GSA and DLA, in consultation with DOE, other \n                agencies, States, and industry and other nongovernment \n                organizations, shall provide all agencies with \n                information on specific products that meet the energy-\n                efficiency criteria of this section. Product \n                information should be made available in both printed \n                and electronic formats.\n\n                    (b) Federal Market Opportunities. DOE, after \n                consultation with industry, utilities, and other \n                interested parties, shall identify advanced energy-\n                efficient and water-conserving technologies that are \n                technically and commercially feasible but not yet \n                available on the open market. These technologies may \n                include, but are not limited to, the advanced appliance \n                technologies referenced in section 127 of the Energy \n                Policy Act of 1992. DOE, in cooperation with OMB, GSA, \n                DOD, the National Institute of Standards and Technology \n                (``NIST''), and EPA, shall issue a ``Federal \n                Procurement Challenge'' inviting each Federal agency to \n                commit a specified fraction of their purchases within a \n                given time period to advanced, high-efficiency models \n                of products, provided that these anticipated future \n                products can meet the agency's energy performance, \n                functionality, and cost requirements.\n                    (c) Accelerated Retirement of Inefficient \n                Equipment. DOE, in consultation with GSA and other \n                agencies, shall establish guidelines for the cost-\n                effective early retirement of older, inefficient \n                appliances and other energy and water-using equipment \n                in Federal facilities. Such guidelines may take into \n                account significant improvements in energy efficiency \n                and water conservation, opportunities to down-size or \n                otherwise optimize the replacement equipment as a \n                result of associated improvements in building envelope, \n                system, or industrial process efficiency and reductions \n                in pollutant emissions, use of chlorofluorocarbons, and \n                other environmental improvements.\n                    (d) Review of Barriers. Each agency shall review \n                and revise Federal or military specifications, product \n                descriptions, and standards to eliminate barriers to, \n                and encourage Federal procurement of, products that are \n                energy-efficient or water conserving.\n\n                PART 6--WAIVERS\n\n                Sec. 601. Waivers. Each agency may determine whether \n                certain requirements in this order are inconsistent \n                with the mission of the agency and seek a waiver of the \n                provision from the Secretary of Energy. Any waivers \n                authorized by the Secretary of Energy shall be included \n                in the annual report on Federal energy management \n                required under the Act.\n\n                PART 7--REVOCATION, LIMITATION, AND IMPLEMENTATION\n\n                Sec. 701. Executive Order No. 12759, of April 17, 1991, \n                is hereby revoked, except that sections 3, 9, and 10 of \n                that order shall remain effective and shall not be \n                revoked.\n\n                Sec. 702.

(``the EAR''). Accordingly, it is \n                hereby ordered as follows:\n\n                Section 1. Treatment of Encryption Products. In order \n                to provide for appropriate controls on the export and \n                foreign dissemination of encryption products, export \n                controls of encryption products that are or would be, \n                on this date, designated as defense articles in \n                Category XIII of the United States Munitions List and \n                regulated by the United States Department of State \n                pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2778 \n                et seq.

This broad \n                competition is best achieved where there is an \n                expansive pool of potential contractors capable of \n                producing quality goods and services at competitive \n                prices. A great and largely untapped opportunity for \n                expanding the pool of such contractors can be found in \n                this Nation's economically distressed communities.\n\n                 Fostering growth of Federal contractors in \n                economically distressed communities and ensuring that \n                those contractors become viable businesses for the long \n                term will promote economy and efficiency in Federal \n                procurement and help to empower those communities. \n                Fostering growth of long-term viable contractors will \n                be promoted by offering appropriate incentives to \n                qualified businesses.\n\n                 Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as \n                President by the Constitution and the laws of the \n                United States, including section 486(a) of title 40, \n                United States Code, and section 301 of title 3, United \n                States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:\n\n                 Section 1. Policy. The purpose of this order is to \n                strengthen the economy and to improve the efficiency of \n                the Federal procurement system by encouraging business \n                development that expands the industrial base and \n                increases competition.\n\n                 Sec. 2.

As \n                appropriate, such recommendation may be with the \n                benefit of consultation and discussions in interagency \n                groups established to provide expertise and coordinate \n                interagency consultation. A recommendation that the \n                Secretary deny a license shall include a statement of \n                the reasons for such recommendation that are consistent \n                with the provisions of the Act and the Regulations or \n                any renewal of, or successor to, the Export \n                Administration Act and the Regulations and shall cite \n                both the statutory and the regulatory bases for the \n                recommendation to deny. A department or agency that \n                fails to provide a recommendation within 30 days with a \n                statement of reasons and the statutory and regulatory \n                bases shall be deemed to have no objection to the \n                decision of the Secretary.\n\n                Sec. 5. Interagency Dispute Resolution. (a) Committees. \n                (1)(A) Export Administration Review Board.

A \n                department or agency must appeal a matter within 5 days \n                of such a decision. Appeals must be in writing from an \n                official appointed by the President by and with the \n                advice and consent of the Senate, or an officer \n                properly acting in such capacity, and must cite both \n                the statutory and the regulatory bases for the appeal. \n                The ACEP shall review all departments' and agencies' \n                information and recommendations, and the Chair of the \n                ACEP shall inform the reviewing departments and \n                agencies of the majority vote decision of the ACEP \n                within 11 days from the date of receiving notice of the \n                appeal. Within 5 days of the majority vote decision, \n                any dissenting department or agency may appeal the \n                decision by submitting a letter from the head of the \n                department or agency to the Secretary in his or her \n                capacity as the Chair of the Board. Such letter shall \n                cite both the statutory and the regulatory bases for \n                the appeal. Within the same period of time, the \n                Secretary may call a meeting on his or her own \n                initiative to consider a license application. In the \n                absence of a timely appeal, the majority vote decision \n                of the ACEP shall be final.\n                      (2) The Board shall review all departments' and \n                agencies' information and recommendations, and such \n                other export control matters as may be appropriate.

In the absence of a timely appeal, the \n                majority vote decision of the Board shall be final.\n\n                Sec. 6. The license review process in this order shall \n                take effect beginning with those license applications \n                registered by the Secretary 60 days after the date of \n                this order and shall continue in effect to the extent \n                not inconsistent with any renewal of the Export \n                Administration Act, or with any successor to that Act. \n                \n[[Page 62985]]\n\n\n                Sec. 7.

The domestic industrial and technological \n                base is the foundation for national defense \n                preparedness. The authorities provided in the Act shall \n                be used to strengthen this base and to ensure it is \n                capable of responding to all threats to the national \n                security of the United States.\n\n                Sec. 103.

Since the \n                formation of the Union, the United States has \n                recognized Indian tribes as domestic dependent nations \n                under its protection. In treaties, our Nation has \n                guaranteed the right of Indian tribes to self-\n                government. As domestic dependent nations, Indian \n                tribes exercise inherent sovereign powers over their \n                members and territory. The United States continues to \n                work with Indian tribes on a government-to-government \n                basis to address issues concerning Indian tribal self-\n                government, trust resources, and Indian tribal treaty \n                and other rights.\n\n                    Therefore, by the authority vested in me as \n                President by the Constitution and the laws of the \n                United States of America, and in order to establish \n                regular and meaningful consultation and collaboration \n                with Indian tribal governments in the development of \n                regulatory practices on Federal matters that \n                significantly or uniquely affect their communities; to \n                reduce the imposition of unfunded mandates upon Indian \n                tribal governments; and to streamline the application \n                process for and increase the availability of waivers to \n                Indian tribal governments; it is hereby ordered as \n                follows:\n\n                Section 1. Definitions. For purposes of this order:\n\n                    (a) ``State'' or ``States'' refer to the States of \n                the United States of America, individually or \n                collectively, and, where relevant, to State \n                governments, including units of local government and \n                other political subdivisions established by the States.\n                    (b) ``Indian tribe'' means an Indian or Alaska \n                Native tribe, band, nation, pueblo, village, or \n                community that the Secretary of the Interior \n                acknowledges to exist as an Indian tribe pursuant to \n                the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994, \n                25 U.S.C. 479a.\n                    (c) ``Agency'' means any authority of the United \n                States that is an ``agency'' under 44 U.S.C. 3502(1), \n                other than those considered to be independent \n                regulatory agencies, as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(5).\n\n                Sec. 2. Policymaking Criteria. In formulating policies \n                significantly or uniquely affecting Indian tribal \n                governments, agencies shall be guided, to the extent \n                permitted by law, by principles of respect for Indian \n                tribal self-government and sovereignty, for tribal \n                treaty and other rights, and for responsibilities that \n                arise from the unique legal relationship between the \n                Federal Government and Indian tribal governments.\n\n                Sec. 3. Consultation. (a) Each agency shall have an \n                effective process to permit elected officials and other \n                representatives of Indian tribal governments to provide \n                meaningful and timely input in the development of \n                regulatory policies on matters that significantly or \n                uniquely affect their communities.\n\n                    (b) To the extent practicable and permitted by law, \n                no agency shall promulgate any regulation that is not \n                required by statute, that significantly or uniquely \n                affects the communities of the Indian tribal \n                governments, and that imposes substantial direct \n                compliance costs on such communities, unless:\n\n[[Page 27656]]\n\n                    L  (1) funds necessary to pay the direct costs \n                incurred by the Indian tribal government in complying \n                with the regulation are provided by the Federal \n                Government; or\n                    L  (2) the agency, prior to the formal promulgation \n                of the regulation,\n\n                L  (A) in a separately identified portion of the \n                preamble to the regulation as it is to be issued in the \n                Federal Register, provides to the Director of the \n                Office of Management and Budget a description of the \n                extent of the agency's prior consultation with \n                representatives of affected Indian tribal governments, \n                a summary of the nature of their concerns, and the \n                agency's position supporting the need to issue the \n                regulation; and\n                L  (B) makes available to the Director of the Office of \n                Management and Budget any written communications \n                submitted to the agency by such Indian tribal \n                governments.\n\n                Sec. 4. Increasing Flexibility for Indian Tribal \n                Waivers. (a) Agencies shall review the processes under \n                which Indian tribal governments apply for waivers of \n                statutory and regulatory requirements and take \n                appropriate steps to streamline those processes.\n\n                    (b) Each agency shall, to the extent practicable \n                and permitted by law, consider any application by an \n                Indian tribal government for a waiver of statutory or \n                regulatory requirements in connection with any program \n                administered by that agency with a general view toward \n                increasing opportunities for utilizing flexible policy \n                approaches at the Indian tribal level in cases in which \n                the proposed waiver is consistent with the applicable \n                Federal policy objectives and is otherwise appropriate.\n                    (c) Each agency shall, to the extent practicable \n                and permitted by law, render a decision upon a complete \n                application for a waiver within 120 days of receipt of \n                such application by the agency. The agency shall \n                provide the applicant with timely written notice of the \n                decision and, if the application for a waiver is not \n                granted, the reasons for such denial.\n                    (d) This section applies only to statutory or \n                regulatory requirements that are discretionary and \n                subject to waiver by the agency.\n\n                Sec. 5. Cooperation in developing regulations. On \n                issues relating to tribal self-government, trust \n                resources, or treaty and other rights, each agency \n                should explore and, where appropriate, use consensual \n                mechanisms for developing regulations, including \n                negotiated rulemaking.\n\n                Sec. 6. Independent agencies. Independent regulatory \n                agencies are encouraged to comply with the provisions \n                of this order.\n\n                Sec. 7. General provisions. (a) This order is intended \n                only to improve the internal management of the \n                executive branch and is not intended to, and does not, \n                create any right, benefit, or trust responsibility, \n                substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity \n                by a party against the United States, its agencies or \n                instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any \n                other person.\n\n                    (b) This order shall supplement but not supersede \n                the requirements contained in Executive Order 12866 \n                (``Regulatory Planning and Review''), Executive Order \n                12988 (``Civil Justice Reform''), OMB Circular A-19, \n                and the Executive Memorandum of April 29, 1994, on \n                Government-to-Government Relations with Native American \n                Tribal Governments.\n                    (c) This order shall complement the consultation \n                and waiver provisions in sections 4 and 5 of the \n                Executive order, entitled ``Federalism,'' being issued \n                on this day.\n\n[[Page 27657]]\n\n                    (d) This order shall be effective 90 days after the \n                date of this order.\n\n                    (Presidential Sig.)<clinton1><clinton2>\n\n                THE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n                    May 14, 1998.\n\n[FR Doc. 98-13553\nFiled 5-18-98; 11:24 am]\nBilling code 3195-01-P\n\n\n</clinton2></clinton1></pre>]","url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/1998/05/19/98-13553/consultation-and-coordination-with-indian-tribal-governments","president":"clinton","id":"13084"},"reftime":1418257597151}

While the primary purpose of the Debt Collection \n                Improvement Act is to increase the collection of nontax \n                debts owed to the Federal Government, the Act also \n                contains important provisions that can be used to \n                assist families in collecting past-due child support \n                obligations.\n\n                The failure of some parents to meet their child support \n                obligations threatens the health, education, and well-\n                being of their children. Compounding this problem, \n                States have experienced difficulties enforcing child \n                support obligations once a parent has moved to another \n                State. With this Executive order, my Administration \n                takes additional steps to support our children and \n                strengthen American families by facilitating the \n                collection of delinquent child support obligations from \n                persons who may be entitled or eligible to receive \n                certain Federal payments or Federal assistance.\n\n                Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President \n                by the Constitution and the laws of the United States \n                of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:\n\n                Section 1.

(a)(1) The Secretary \n                of the Treasury (``the Secretary''), in accordance with \n                the provisions of the Debt Collection Improvement Act \n                of 1996 and to the extent permitted by law, and in \n                consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human \n                Services and other affected agencies, shall promptly \n                develop and implement procedures necessary for the \n                Secretary to collect past-due child support debts by \n                administrative offset, and shall issue such rules, \n                regulations, and procedures as the Secretary, in \n                consultation with the heads of affected agencies, deems \n                appropriate to govern administrative offsets by the \n                Department of the Treasury and other executive \n                departments and agencies that disburse Federal \n                payments.\n\n                    (2) The Secretary may enter into reciprocal \n                agreements with States concerning the collection by the \n                Secretary of delinquent child support debts through \n                administrative offsets.\n                    (b) The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n                shall, within 120 days of the date of this order, \n                implement procedures necessary to report to the \n                Secretary of the Treasury information on past-due child \n                support claims referred by States (including claims \n                enforced by States pursuant to cooperative agreements \n                with or by Indian tribal governments) to the Department \n                of Health and Human Services.\n                    (c) The head of each executive department and \n                agency that certifies payments to the Secretary or to \n                another disbursing official shall review each class of \n                payments that the department or agency certifies to \n                determine if any such class should be exempt from \n                offset and, if any class is so identified, submit to \n                the Secretary a request for such an exemption together \n                with the reasons therefor. With respect to classes of \n                payments under means-tested programs existing on the \n                date of this order, such submission shall be made \n                within 30 days of the date of this order. With respect \n                to classes of payments other than payments under means-\n                tested programs existing on the date of this order, \n                such submissions shall be made within 30 days of the \n                date the Secretary establishes standards pursuant to \n                section 3716(c)(3)\n\n[[Page 51764]]\n\n                of title 31, United States Code. With respect to a \n                class of payments established after the date of this \n                order, such submissions shall be made not later than 30 \n                days after such class is established.\n                    (d) The head of each executive department and \n                agency that certifies payments to the Secretary shall \n                promptly implement any rule, regulation, or procedure \n                issued by the Secretary pursuant to this section.\n                    (e) The head of each executive department and \n                agency that is authorized by law to disburse payments \n                shall promptly implement any rule, regulation, or \n                procedure issued by the Secretary pursuant to this \n                section and shall:\n                     (1) match, consistent with computer privacy \n                matching laws, the payment certification records of \n                such department or agency with records of persons \n                delinquent in child support payments as directed by the \n                Secretary; and\n                     (2) conduct administrative offsets to collect \n                delinquent child support payments.\n                    (f) The Secretary shall, to the extent permitted by \n                law, share with the Secretary of Health and Human \n                Services any information contained in payment \n                certification records of persons who are delinquent in \n                child support obligations that would assist in the \n                collection of such debts, whether or not an \n                administrative offset is conducted.\n\n                Sec. 2.

Goals. The Federal Government has a special, \n                historic responsibility for the education of American \n                Indian and Alaska Native students. Improving \n                educational achievement and academic progress for \n                American Indian and Alaska Native students is vital to \n                the national goal of preparing every student for \n                responsible citizenship, continued learning, and \n                productive employment. The Federal Government is \n                committed to improving the academic performance and \n                reducing the dropout rate of American Indian and Alaska \n                Native students. To help fulfill this commitment in a \n                manner consistent with tribal traditions and cultures, \n                Federal agencies need to focus special attention on six \n                goals: (1) improving reading and mathematics; (2) \n                increasing high school completion and postsecondary \n                attendance rates; (3) reducing the influence of long-\n                standing factors that impede educational performance, \n                such as poverty and substance abuse; (4) creating \n                strong, safe, and drug-free school environments; (5) \n                improving science education; and (6) expanding the use \n                of educational technology.\n\n                Sec. 2. Strategy. In order to meet the six goals of \n                this order, a comprehensive Federal response is needed \n                to address the fragmentation of government services \n                available to American Indian and Alaska Native students \n                and the complexity of intergovernmental relationships \n                affecting the education of those students. The purpose \n                of the Federal activities described in this order is to \n                develop a long-term, comprehensive Federal Indian \n                education policy that will accomplish those goals.\n\n                    (a)  Interagency Task Force.

Definitions. For purposes of this order:\n\n                    (a) ``Policies that have federalism implications'' \n                refers to regulations, legislative comments or proposed \n                legislation, and other policy statements or actions \n                that have substantial direct effects on the States, on \n                the relationship between the national government and \n                the States, or on the distribution of power and \n                responsibilities among the various levels of \n                government.\n                    (b) ``State'' or ``States'' refer to the States of \n                the United States of America, individually or \n                collectively, and, where relevant, to State \n                governments, including units of local government and \n                other political subdivisions established by the States.\n                    (c) ``Agency'' means any authority of the United \n                States that is an ``agency'' under 44 U.S.C. 3502(1), \n                other than those considered to be independent \n                regulatory agencies, as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(5).\n                    (d) ``State and local officials'' means elected \n                officials of State and local governments or their \n                representative national organizations.\n\n                Sec. 2. Fundamental Federalism Principles. In \n                formulating and implementing policies that have \n                federalism implications, agencies shall be guided by \n                the following fundamental federalism principles:\n\n                    (a) Federalism is rooted in the belief that issues \n                that are not national in scope or significance are most \n                appropriately addressed by the level of government \n                closest to the people.\n                    (b) The people of the States created the national \n                government and delegated to it enumerated governmental \n                powers. All other sovereign powers, save those \n                expressly prohibited the States by the Constitution, \n                are reserved to the States or to the people.\n                    (c) The constitutional relationship among sovereign \n                governments, State and national, is inherent in the \n                very structure of the Constitution and is formalized in \n                and protected by the Tenth Amendment to the \n                Constitution.\n                    (d) The people of the States are free, subject only \n                to restrictions in the Constitution itself or in \n                constitutionally authorized Acts of Congress, to define \n                the moral, political, and legal character of their \n                lives.\n                    (e) The Framers recognized that the States possess \n                unique authorities, qualities, and abilities to meet \n                the needs of the people and should function as \n                laboratories of democracy.\n\n[[Page 43256]]\n\n                    (f) The nature of our constitutional system \n                encourages a healthy diversity in the public policies \n                adopted by the people of the several States according \n                to their own conditions, needs, and desires. In the \n                search for enlightened public policy, individual States \n                and communities are free to experiment with a variety \n                of approaches to public issues. One-size-fits-all \n                approaches to public policy problems can inhibit the \n                creation of effective solutions to those problems.\n                    (g) Acts of the national government--whether \n                legislative, executive, or judicial in nature--that \n                exceed the enumerated powers of that government under \n                the Constitution violate the principle of federalism \n                established by the Framers.\n                    (h) Policies of the national government should \n                recognize the responsibility of--and should encourage \n                opportunities for--individuals, families, \n                neighborhoods, local governments, and private \n                associations to achieve their personal, social, and \n                economic objectives through cooperative effort.\n                    (i) The national government should be deferential \n                to the States when taking action that affects the \n                policymaking discretion of the States and should act \n                only with the greatest caution where State or local \n                governments have identified uncertainties regarding the \n                constitutional or statutory authority of the national \n                government.\n\n                Sec. 3. Federalism Policymaking Criteria. In addition \n                to adhering to the fundamental federalism principles \n                set forth in section 2, agencies shall adhere, to the \n                extent permitted by law, to the following criteria when \n                formulating and implementing policies that have \n                federalism implications:\n\n                    (a) There shall be strict adherence to \n                constitutional principles. Agencies shall closely \n                examine the constitutional and statutory authority \n                supporting any action that would limit the policymaking \n                discretion of the States and shall carefully assess the \n                necessity for such action. To the extent practicable, \n                State and local officials shall be consulted before any \n                such action is implemented. Executive Order 12372 of \n                July 14, 1982 (``Intergovernmental Review of Federal \n                Programs'') remains in effect for the programs and \n                activities to which it is applicable.\n                    (b) National action limiting the policymaking \n                discretion of the States shall be taken only where \n                there is constitutional and statutory authority for the \n                action and the national activity is appropriate in \n                light of the presence of a problem of national \n                significance. Where there are significant uncertainties \n                as to whether national action is authorized or \n                appropriate, agencies shall consult with appropriate \n                State and local officials to determine whether Federal \n                objectives can be attained by other means.\n                    (c) With respect to Federal statutes and \n                regulations administered by the States, the national \n                government shall grant the States the maximum \n                administrative discretion possible. Intrusive Federal \n                oversight of State administration is neither necessary \n                nor desirable.\n                    (d) When undertaking to formulate and implement \n                policies that have federalism implications, agencies \n                shall:\n                    L  (1) encourage States to develop their own \n                policies to achieve program objectives and to work with \n                appropriate officials in other States;\n                    L  (2) where possible, defer to the States to \n                establish standards;\n                    L  (3) in determining whether to establish uniform \n                national standards, consult with appropriate State and \n                local officials as to the need for national standards \n                and any alternatives that would limit the scope of \n                national standards or otherwise preserve State \n                prerogatives and authority; and\n                    L  (4) where national standards are required by \n                Federal statutes, consult with appropriate State and \n                local officials in developing those standards.\n\n[[Page 43257]]\n\n                Sec. 4.

Our democratic principles require that the \n                American people be informed of the activities of their \n                Government. Also, our Nation's progress depends on the \n                free flow of information. Nevertheless, throughout our \n                history, the national interest has required that \n                certain information be maintained in confidence in \n                order to protect our citizens, our democratic \n                institutions, and our participation within the \n                community of nations. Protecting information critical \n                to our Nation's security remains a priority. In recent \n                years, however, dramatic changes have altered, although \n                not eliminated, the national security threats that we \n                confront.

[[Page 19827]] \n\n                Sec. 1.4. Classification Authority. (a) The authority \n                to classify information originally may be exercised \n                only by:\n\n                (1) the President;\n                (2) agency heads and officials designated by the \n                President in the Federal Register; or\n                (3) United States Government officials delegated this \n                authority pursuant to paragraph (c), below.\n\n                    (b) Officials authorized to classify information at \n                a specified level are also authorized to classify \n                information at a lower level.\n                    (c) Delegation of original classification \n                authority.\n                (1) Delegations of original classification authority \n                shall be limited to the minimum required to administer \n                this order. Agency heads are responsible for ensuring \n                that designated subordinate officials have a \n                demonstrable and continuing need to exercise this \n                authority.\n                (2) ``Top Secret'' original classification authority \n                may be delegated only by the President or by an agency \n                head or official designated pursuant to paragraph \n                (a)(2), above.\n                (3) ``Secret'' or ``Confidential'' original \n                classification authority may be delegated only by the \n                President; an agency head or official designated \n                pursuant to paragraph (a)(2), above; or the senior \n                agency official, provided that official has been \n                delegated ``Top Secret'' original classification \n                authority by the agency head.\n                (4) Each delegation of original classification \n                authority shall be in writing and the authority shall \n                not be redelegated except as provided in this order. \n                Each delegation shall identify the official by name or \n                position title.\n\n                    (d) Original classification authorities must \n                receive training in original classification as provided \n                in this order and its implementing directives.\n                    (e) Exceptional cases. When an employee, \n                contractor, licensee, certificate holder, or grantee of \n                an agency that does not have original classification \n                authority originates information believed by that \n                person to require classification, the information shall \n                be protected in a manner consistent with this order and \n                its implementing directives. The information shall be \n                transmitted promptly as provided under this order or \n                its implementing directives to the agency that has \n                appropriate subject matter interest and classification \n                authority with respect to this information. That agency \n                shall decide within 30 days whether to classify this \n                information. If it is not clear which agency has \n                classification responsibility for this information, it \n                shall be sent to the Director of the Information \n                Security Oversight Office. The Director shall determine \n                the agency having primary subject matter interest and \n                forward the information, with appropriate \n                recommendations, to that agency for a classification \n                determination.\n\n                Sec. 1.5.  Classification Categories.\n\n                Information may not be considered for classification \n                unless it concerns:\n\n                    (a) military plans, weapons systems, or operations;\n                    (b) foreign government information;\n                    (c) intelligence activities (including special \n                activities), intelligence sources or methods, or \n                cryptology;\n                    (d) foreign relations or foreign activities of the \n                United States, including confidential sources;\n                    (e) scientific, technological, or economic matters \n                relating to the national security;\n                    (f) United States Government programs for \n                safeguarding nuclear materials or facilities; or\n                    (g) vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, \n                installations, projects or plans relating to the \n                national security.\n\n                Sec. 1.6. Duration of Classification. (a) At the time \n                of original classification, the original classification \n                authority shall attempt to establish a specific date \n                [[Page 19828]] or event for declassification based upon \n                the duration of the national security sensitivity of \n                the information. The date or event shall not exceed the \n                time frame in paragraph (b), below.\n\n                    (b) If the original classification authority cannot \n                determine an earlier specific date or event for \n                declassification, information shall be marked for \n                declassification 10 years from the date of the original \n                decision, except as provided in paragraph (d), below.\n                    (c) An original classification authority may extend \n                the duration of classification or reclassify specific \n                information for successive periods not to exceed 10 \n                years at a time if such action is consistent with the \n                standards and procedures established under this order. \n                This provision does not apply to information contained \n                in records that are more than 25 years old and have \n                been determined to have permanent historical value \n                under title 44, United States Code.\n                    (d) At the time of original classification, the \n                original classification authority may exempt from \n                declassification within 10 years specific information, \n                the unauthorized disclosure of which could reasonably \n                be expected to cause damage to the national security \n                for a period greater than that provided in paragraph \n                (b), above, and the release of which could reasonably \n                be expected to:\n                (1) reveal an intelligence source, method, or activity, \n                or a cryptologic system or activity;\n                (2) reveal information that would assist in the \n                development or use of weapons of mass destruction;\n                (3) reveal information that would impair the \n                development or use of technology within a United States \n                weapons system;\n                (4) reveal United States military plans, or national \n                security emergency preparedness plans;\n                (5) reveal foreign government information;\n                (6) damage relations between the United States and a \n                foreign government, reveal a confidential source, or \n                seriously undermine diplomatic activities that are \n                reasonably expected to be ongoing for a period greater \n                than that provided in paragraph (b), above;\n                (7) impair the ability of responsible United States \n                Government officials to protect the President, the Vice \n                President, and other individuals for whom protection \n                services, in the interest of national security, are \n                authorized; or\n                (8) violate a statute, treaty, or international \n                agreement.\n\n                    (e) Information marked for an indefinite duration \n                of classification under predecessor orders, for \n                example, ``Originating Agency's Determination \n                Required,'' or information classified under predecessor \n                orders that contains no declassification instructions \n                shall be declassified in accordance with part 3 of this \n                order.\n\n                Sec. 1.7. Identification and Markings. (a) At the time \n                of original classification, the following shall appear \n                on the face of each classified document, or shall be \n                applied to other classified media in an appropriate \n                manner:\n\n                (1) one of the three classification levels defined in \n                section 1.3 of this order;\n                (2) the identity, by name or personal identifier and \n                position, of the original classification authority;\n                (3) the agency and office of origin, if not otherwise \n                evident;\n                (4) declassification instructions, which shall indicate \n                one of the following:\n                  (A) the date or event for declassification, as \n                prescribed in section 1.6(a) or section 1.6(c); or\n                  (B) the date that is 10 years from the date of \n                original classification, as prescribed in section \n                1.6(b); or\n                  (C) the exemption category from declassification, as \n                prescribed in section 1.6(d); and\n                (5) a concise reason for classification which, at a \n                minimum, cites the applicable classification categories \n                in section 1.5 of this order. [[Page 19829]] \n\n                    (b) Specific information contained in paragraph \n                (a), above, may be excluded if it would reveal \n                additional classified information.\n                    (c) Each classified document shall, by marking or \n                other means, indicate which portions are classified, \n                with the applicable classification level, which \n                portions are exempt from declassification under section \n                1.6(d) of this order, and which portions are \n                unclassified. In accordance with standards prescribed \n                in directives issued under this order, the Director of \n                the Information Security Oversight Office may grant \n                waivers of this requirement for specified classes of \n                documents or information. The Director shall revoke any \n                waiver upon a finding of abuse.\n                    (d) Markings implementing the provisions of this \n                order, including abbreviations and requirements to \n                safeguard classified working papers, shall conform to \n                the standards prescribed in implementing directives \n                issued pursuant to this order.\n                    (e) Foreign government information shall retain its \n                original classification markings or shall be assigned a \n                U.S. classification that provides a degree of \n                protection at least equivalent to that required by the \n                entity that furnished the information.\n                    (f) Information assigned a level of classification \n                under this or predecessor orders shall be considered as \n                classified at that level of classification despite the \n                omission of other required markings. Whenever such \n                information is used in the derivative classification \n                process or is reviewed for possible declassification, \n                holders of such information shall coordinate with an \n                appropriate classification authority for the \n                application of omitted markings.\n                    (g) The classification authority shall, whenever \n                practicable, use a classified addendum whenever \n                classified information constitutes a small portion of \n                an otherwise unclassified document.\n\n                Sec. 1.8. Classification Prohibitions and Limitations. \n                (a) In no case shall information be classified in order \n                to:\n\n                (1) conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or \n                administrative error;\n                (2) prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or \n                agency;\n                (3) restrain competition; or\n                (4) prevent or delay the release of information that \n                does not require protection in the interest of national \n                security.\n\n                    (b) Basic scientific research information not \n                clearly related to the national security may not be \n                classified.\n                    (c) Information may not be reclassified after it \n                has been declassified and released to the public under \n                proper authority.\n                    (d) Information that has not previously been \n                disclosed to the public under proper authority may be \n                classified or reclassified after an agency has received \n                a request for it under the Freedom of Information Act \n                (5 U.S.C. 552) or the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. \n                552a), or the mandatory review provisions of section \n                3.6 of this order only if such classification meets the \n                requirements of this order and is accomplished on a \n                document-by-document basis with the personal \n                participation or under the direction of the agency \n                head, the deputy agency head, or the senior agency \n                official designated under section 5.6 of this order. \n                This provision does not apply to classified information \n                contained in records that are more than 25 years old \n                and have been determined to have permanent historical \n                value under title 44, United States Code.\n                    (e) Compilations of items of information which are \n                individually unclassified may be classified if the \n                compiled information reveals an additional association \n                or relationship that:\n                (1) meets the standards for classification under this \n                order; and\n                (2) is not otherwise revealed in the individual items \n                of information.\n\n                As used in this order, ``compilation'' means an \n                aggregation of pre-existing unclassified items of \n                information.

(a) Authorized \n                holders of information who, in good faith, believe that \n                its classification status is improper are encouraged \n                and expected to challenge the classification status of \n                the information in accordance with agency procedures \n                established under paragraph (b), below.\n\n                    (b) In accordance with implementing directives \n                issued pursuant to this order, an agency head or senior \n                agency official shall establish procedures under which \n                authorized holders of information are encouraged and \n                expected to challenge the classification of information \n                that they believe is improperly classified or \n                unclassified. These procedures shall assure that:\n                 (1) individuals are not subject to retribution for \n                bringing such actions;\n                (2) an opportunity is provided for review by an \n                impartial official or panel; and\n                (3) individuals are advised of their right to appeal \n                agency decisions to the Interagency Security \n                Classification Appeals Panel established by section 5.4 \n                of this order.\n\n                PART 2--DERIVATIVE CLASSIFICATION\n\n                Sec. 2.1. Definitions. For purposes of this order:\n\n                    (a) ``Derivative classification'' means the \n                incorporating, paraphrasing, restating or generating in \n                new form information that is already classified, and \n                marking the newly developed material consistent with \n                the classification markings that apply to the source \n                information. Derivative classification includes the \n                classification of information based on classification \n                guidance. The duplication or reproduction of existing \n                classified information is not derivative \n                classification.\n                    (b) ``Classification guidance'' means any \n                instruction or source that prescribes the \n                classification of specific information.\n                    (c) ``Classification guide'' means a documentary \n                form of classification guidance issued by an original \n                classification authority that identifies the elements \n                of information regarding a specific subject that must \n                be classified and establishes the level and duration of \n                classification for each such element.\n                    (d) ``Source document'' means an existing document \n                that contains classified information that is \n                incorporated, paraphrased, restated, or generated in \n                new form into a new document.\n                    (e) ``Multiple sources'' means two or more source \n                documents, classification guides, or a combination of \n                both.\n\n                Sec. 2.2. Use of Derivative Classification. (a) Persons \n                who only reproduce, extract, or summarize classified \n                information, or who only apply classification markings \n                derived from source material or as directed by a \n                classification guide, need not possess original \n                classification authority.\n\n                    (b) Persons who apply derivative classification \n                markings shall:\n                (1) observe and respect original classification \n                decisions; and\n                (2) carry forward to any newly created documents the \n                pertinent classification markings. For information \n                derivatively classified based on multiple sources, the \n                derivative classifier shall carry forward:\n                  (A) the date or event for declassification that \n                corresponds to the longest period of classification \n                among the sources; and\n                  (B) a listing of these sources on or attached to the \n                official file or record copy.\n\n                Sec. 2.3. Classification Guides. (a) Agencies with \n                original classification authority shall prepare \n                classification guides to facilitate the proper and \n                uniform derivative classification of information. These \n                guides shall conform to standards contained in \n                directives issued under this order.\n\n                    (b) Each guide shall be approved personally and in \n                writing by an official who:\n                (1) has program or supervisory responsibility over the \n                information or is the senior agency official; and \n                [[Page 19831]] \n                (2) is authorized to classify information originally at \n                the highest level of classification prescribed in the \n                guide.\n\n                    (c) Agencies shall establish procedures to assure \n                that classification guides are reviewed and updated as \n                provided in directives issued under this order.\n\n                PART 3--DECLASSIFICATION AND DOWNGRADING\n\n                Sec. 3.1. Definitions. For purposes of this order:\n\n                    (a) ``Declassification'' means the authorized \n                change in the status of information from classified \n                information to unclassified information.\n                    (b) ``Automatic declassification'' means the \n                declassification of information based solely upon:\n                (1) the occurrence of a specific date or event as \n                determined by the original classification authority; or\n                (2) the expiration of a maximum time frame for duration \n                of classification established under this order.\n\n                    (c) ``Declassification authority'' means:\n                (1) the official who authorized the original \n                classification, if that official is still serving in \n                the same position;\n                (2) the originator's current successor in function;\n                (3) a supervisory official of either; or\n                (4) officials delegated declassification authority in \n                writing by the agency head or the senior agency \n                official.\n\n                    (d) ``Mandatory declassification review'' means the \n                review for declassification of classified information \n                in response to a request for declassification that \n                meets the requirements under section 3.6 of this order.\n                    (e) ``Systematic declassification review'' means \n                the review for declassification of classified \n                information contained in records that have been \n                determined by the Archivist of the United States \n                (``Archivist'') to have permanent historical value in \n                accordance with chapter 33 of title 44, United States \n                Code.\n                    (f) ``Declassification guide'' means written \n                instructions issued by a declassification authority \n                that describes the elements of information regarding a \n                specific subject that may be declassified and the \n                elements that must remain classified.\n                    (g) ``Downgrading'' means a determination by a \n                declassification authority that information classified \n                and safeguarded at a specified level shall be \n                classified and safeguarded at a lower level.\n                    (h) ``File series'' means documentary material, \n                regardless of its physical form or characteristics, \n                that is arranged in accordance with a filing system or \n                maintained as a unit because it pertains to the same \n                function or activity.\n\n                Sec. 3.2. Authority for Declassification. (a) \n                Information shall be declassified as soon as it no \n                longer meets the standards for classification under \n                this order.\n\n                    (b) It is presumed that information that continues \n                to meet the classification requirements under this \n                order requires continued protection. In some \n                exceptional cases, however, the need to protect such \n                information may be outweighed by the public interest in \n                disclosure of the information, and in these cases the \n                information should be declassified. When such questions \n                arise, they shall be referred to the agency head or the \n                senior agency official. That official will determine, \n                as an exercise of discretion, whether the public \n                interest in disclosure outweighs the damage to national \n                security that might reasonably be expected from \n                disclosure. This provision does not:\n                (1) amplify or modify the substantive criteria or \n                procedures for classification; or\n                (2) create any substantive or procedural rights subject \n                to judicial review.\n\n                    (c) If the Director of the Information Security \n                Oversight Office determines that information is \n                classified in violation of this order, the Director may \n                require the information to be declassified by the \n                agency that originated [[Page 19832]] the \n                classification. Any such decision by the Director may \n                be appealed to the President through the Assistant to \n                the President for National Security Affairs. The \n                information shall remain classified pending a prompt \n                decision on the appeal.\n                    (d) The provisions of this section shall also apply \n                to agencies that, under the terms of this order, do not \n                have original classification authority, but had such \n                authority under predecessor orders.\n\n                Sec. 3.3. Transferred Information. (a) In the case of \n                classified information transferred in conjunction with \n                a transfer of functions, and not merely for storage \n                purposes, the receiving agency shall be deemed to be \n                the originating agency for purposes of this order.\n\n                    (b) In the case of classified information that is \n                not officially transferred as described in paragraph \n                (a), above, but that originated in an agency that has \n                ceased to exist and for which there is no successor \n                agency, each agency in possession of such information \n                shall be deemed to be the originating agency for \n                purposes of this order. Such information may be \n                declassified or downgraded by the agency in possession \n                after consultation with any other agency that has an \n                interest in the subject matter of the information.\n                    (c) Classified information accessioned into the \n                National Archives and Records Administration \n                (``National Archives'') as of the effective date of \n                this order shall be declassified or downgraded by the \n                Archivist in accordance with this order, the directives \n                issued pursuant to this order, agency declassification \n                guides, and any existing procedural agreement between \n                the Archivist and the relevant agency head.\n                    (d) The originating agency shall take all \n                reasonable steps to declassify classified information \n                contained in records determined to have permanent \n                historical value before they are accessioned into the \n                National Archives. However, the Archivist may require \n                that records containing classified information be \n                accessioned into the National Archives when necessary \n                to comply with the provisions of the Federal Records \n                Act. This provision does not apply to information being \n                transferred to the Archivist pursuant to section 2203 \n                of title 44, United States Code, or information for \n                which the National Archives and Records Administration \n                serves as the custodian of the records of an agency or \n                organization that goes out of existence.\n                    (e) To the extent practicable, agencies shall adopt \n                a system of records management that will facilitate the \n                public release of documents at the time such documents \n                are declassified pursuant to the provisions for \n                automatic declassification in sections 1.6 and 3.4 of \n                this order.\n\n                Sec. 3.4.

(a) Subject to \n                paragraph (b), below, within 5 years from the date of \n                this order, all classified information contained in \n                records that (1) are more than 25 years old, and (2) \n                have been determined to have permanent historical value \n                under title 44, United States Code, shall be \n                automatically declassified whether or not the records \n                have been reviewed. Subsequently, all classified \n                information in such records shall be automatically \n                declassified no longer than 25 years from the date of \n                its original classification, except as provided in \n                paragraph (b), below.\n\n                    (b) An agency head may exempt from automatic \n                declassification under paragraph (a), above, specific \n                information, the release of which should be expected \n                to:\n                (1) reveal the identity of a confidential human source, \n                or reveal information about the application of an \n                intelligence source or method, or reveal the identity \n                of a human intelligence source when the unauthorized \n                disclosure of that source would clearly and \n                demonstrably damage the national security interests of \n                the United States;\n                (2) reveal information that would assist in the \n                development or use of weapons of mass destruction;\n                (3) reveal information that would impair U.S. \n                cryptologic systems or activities;\n                (4) reveal information that would impair the \n                application of state of the art technology within a \n                U.S. weapon system; [[Page 19833]] \n                (5) reveal actual U.S. military war plans that remain \n                in effect;\n                (6) reveal information that would seriously and \n                demonstrably impair relations between the United States \n                and a foreign government, or seriously and demonstrably \n                undermine ongoing diplomatic activities of the United \n                States;\n                (7) reveal information that would clearly and \n                demonstrably impair the current ability of United \n                States Government officials to protect the President, \n                Vice President, and other officials for whom protection \n                services, in the interest of national security, are \n                authorized;\n                (8) reveal information that would seriously and \n                demonstrably impair current national security emergency \n                preparedness plans; or\n                (9) violate a statute, treaty, or international \n                agreement.\n\n                    (c) No later than the effective date of this order, \n                an agency head shall notify the President through the \n                Assistant to the President for National Security \n                Affairs of any specific file series of records for \n                which a review or assessment has determined that the \n                information within those file series almost invariably \n                falls within one or more of the exemption categories \n                listed in paragraph (b), above, and which the agency \n                proposes to exempt from automatic declassification. The \n                notification shall include:\n                (1) a description of the file series;\n                (2) an explanation of why the information within the \n                file series is almost invariably exempt from automatic \n                declassification and why the information must remain \n                classified for a longer period of time; and\n                (3) except for the identity of a confidential human \n                source or a human intelligence source, as provided in \n                paragraph (b), above, a specific date or event for \n                declassification of the information.\n\n                The President may direct the agency head not to exempt \n                the file series or to declassify the information within \n                that series at an earlier date than recommended.\n\n                    (d) At least 180 days before information is \n                automatically declassified under this section, an \n                agency head or senior agency official shall notify the \n                Director of the Information Security Oversight Office, \n                serving as Executive Secretary of the Interagency \n                Security Classification Appeals Panel, of any specific \n                information beyond that included in a notification to \n                the President under paragraph (c), above, that the \n                agency proposes to exempt from automatic \n                declassification. The notification shall include:\n                (1) a description of the information;\n                (2) an explanation of why the information is exempt \n                from automatic declassification and must remain \n                classified for a longer period of time; and\n                (3) except for the identity of a confidential human \n                source or a human intelligence source, as provided in \n                paragraph (b), above, a specific date or event for \n                declassification of the information. The Panel may \n                direct the agency not to exempt the information or to \n                declassify it at an earlier date than recommended. The \n                agency head may appeal such a decision to the President \n                through the Assistant to the President for National \n                Security Affairs. The information will remain \n                classified while such an appeal is pending.\n\n                    (e) No later than the effective date of this order, \n                the agency head or senior agency official shall provide \n                the Director of the Information Security Oversight \n                Office with a plan for compliance with the requirements \n                of this section, including the establishment of interim \n                target dates. Each such plan shall include the \n                requirement that the agency declassify at least 15 \n                percent of the records affected by this section no \n                later than 1 year from the effective date of this \n                order, and similar commitments for subsequent years \n                until the effective date for automatic \n                declassification.\n                    (f) Information exempted from automatic \n                declassification under this section shall remain \n                subject to the mandatory and systematic \n                declassification review provisions of this order. \n                [[Page 19834]] \n                    (g) The Secretary of State shall determine when the \n                United States should commence negotiations with the \n                appropriate officials of a foreign government or \n                international organization of governments to modify any \n                treaty or international agreement that requires the \n                classification of information contained in records \n                affected by this section for a period longer than 25 \n                years from the date of its creation, unless the treaty \n                or international agreement pertains to information that \n                may otherwise remain classified beyond 25 years under \n                this section.\n\n                Sec. 3.5.

This program shall apply to historically \n                valuable records exempted from automatic \n                declassification under section 3.4 of this order. \n                Agencies shall prioritize the systematic review of \n                records based upon:\n\n                (1) recommendations of the Information Security Policy \n                Advisory Council, established in section 5.5 of this \n                order, on specific subject areas for systematic review \n                concentration; or\n                (2) the degree of researcher interest and the \n                likelihood of declassification upon review.\n\n                    (b) The Archivist shall conduct a systematic \n                declassification review program for classified \n                information: (1) accessioned into the National Archives \n                as of the effective date of this order; (2) information \n                transferred to the Archivist pursuant to section 2203 \n                of title 44, United States Code; and (3) information \n                for which the National Archives and Records \n                Administration serves as the custodian of the records \n                of an agency or organization that has gone out of \n                existence. This program shall apply to pertinent \n                records no later than 25 years from the date of their \n                creation. The Archivist shall establish priorities for \n                the systematic review of these records based upon the \n                recommendations of the Information Security Policy \n                Advisory Council; or the degree of researcher interest \n                and the likelihood of declassification upon review. \n                These records shall be reviewed in accordance with the \n                standards of this order, its implementing directives, \n                and declassification guides provided to the Archivist \n                by each agency that originated the records.

If the agency \n                has reviewed the information within the past 2 years, \n                or the information is the subject of pending \n                litigation, the agency shall inform the requester of \n                this fact and of the requester's appeal rights.\n\n                    (b) Information originated by:\n                (1) the incumbent President;\n                (2) the incumbent President's White House Staff;\n                (3) committees, commissions, or boards appointed by the \n                incumbent President; or [[Page 19835]] \n                (4) other entities within the Executive Office of the \n                President that solely advise and assist the incumbent \n                President is exempted from the provisions of paragraph \n                (a), above. However, the Archivist shall have the \n                authority to review, downgrade, and declassify \n                information of former Presidents under the control of \n                the Archivist pursuant to sections 2107, 2111, 2111 \n                note, or 2203 of title 44, United States Code. Review \n                procedures developed by the Archivist shall provide for \n                consultation with agencies having primary subject \n                matter interest and shall be consistent with the \n                provisions of applicable laws or lawful agreements that \n                pertain to the respective Presidential papers or \n                records. Agencies with primary subject matter interest \n                shall be notified promptly of the Archivist's decision. \n                Any final decision by the Archivist may be appealed by \n                the requester or an agency to the Interagency Security \n                Classification Appeals Panel. The information shall \n                remain classified pending a prompt decision on the \n                appeal.\n\n                    (c) Agencies conducting a mandatory review for \n                declassification shall declassify information that no \n                longer meets the standards for classification under \n                this order. They shall release this information unless \n                withholding is otherwise authorized and warranted under \n                applicable law.\n                    (d) In accordance with directives issued pursuant \n                to this order, agency heads shall develop procedures to \n                process requests for the mandatory review of classified \n                information. These procedures shall apply to \n                information classified under this or predecessor \n                orders. They also shall provide a means for \n                administratively appealing a denial of a mandatory \n                review request, and for notifying the requester of the \n                right to appeal a final agency decision to the \n                Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel.\n                    (e) After consultation with affected agencies, the \n                Secretary of Defense shall develop special procedures \n                for the review of cryptologic information, the Director \n                of Central Intelligence shall develop special \n                procedures for the review of information pertaining to \n                intelligence activities (including special activities), \n                or intelligence sources or methods, and the Archivist \n                shall develop special procedures for the review of \n                information accessioned into the National Archives.\n\n                Sec. 3.7.

An official or employee leaving agency \n                service may not remove classified information from the \n                agency's control.\n                    (c) Classified information may not be removed from \n                official premises without proper authorization.\n                    (d) Persons authorized to disseminate classified \n                information outside the executive branch shall assure \n                the protection of the information in a manner \n                equivalent to that provided within the executive \n                branch.\n                    (e) Consistent with law, directives, and \n                regulation, an agency head or senior agency official \n                shall establish uniform procedures to ensure that \n                automated information systems, including networks and \n                telecommunications systems, that collect, create, \n                communicate, compute, disseminate, process, or store \n                classified information have controls that:\n                (1) prevent access by unauthorized persons; and\n                (2) ensure the integrity of the information.\n\n                    (f) Consistent with law, directives, and \n                regulation, each agency head or senior agency official \n                shall establish controls to ensure that classified \n                information is used, processed, stored, reproduced, \n                transmitted, and destroyed under conditions that \n                provide adequate protection and prevent access by \n                unauthorized persons. [[Page 19837]] \n                    (g) Consistent with directives issued pursuant to \n                this order, an agency shall safeguard foreign \n                government information under standards that provide a \n                degree of protection at least equivalent to that \n                required by the government or international \n                organization of governments that furnished the \n                information. When adequate to achieve equivalency, \n                these standards may be less restrictive than the \n                safeguarding standards that ordinarily apply to United \n                States ``Confidential'' information, including allowing \n                access to individuals with a need-to-know who have not \n                otherwise been cleared for access to classified \n                information or executed an approved nondisclosure \n                agreement.\n                    (h) Except as provided by statute or directives \n                issued pursuant to this order, classified information \n                originating in one agency may not be disseminated \n                outside any other agency to which it has been made \n                available without the consent of the originating \n                agency. An agency head or senior agency official may \n                waive this requirement for specific information \n                originated within that agency. For purposes of this \n                section, the Department of Defense shall be considered \n                one agency.\n\n                Sec. 4.3. Distribution Controls. (a) Each agency shall \n                establish controls over the distribution of classified \n                information to assure that it is distributed only to \n                organizations or individuals eligible for access who \n                also have a need-to-know the information.\n\n                    (b) Each agency shall update, at least annually, \n                the automatic, routine, or recurring distribution of \n                classified information that they distribute. Recipients \n                shall cooperate fully with distributors who are \n                updating distribution lists and shall notify \n                distributors whenever a relevant change in status \n                occurs.\n\n                Sec. 4.4. Special Access Programs. (a) Establishment of \n                special access programs. Unless otherwise authorized by \n                the President, only the Secretaries of State, Defense \n                and Energy, and the Director of Central Intelligence, \n                or the principal deputy of each, may create a special \n                access program. For special access programs pertaining \n                to intelligence activities (including special \n                activities, but not including military operational, \n                strategic and tactical programs), or intelligence \n                sources or methods, this function will be exercised by \n                the Director of Central Intelligence. These officials \n                shall keep the number of these programs at an absolute \n                minimum, and shall establish them only upon a specific \n                finding that:\n\n                (1) the vulnerability of, or threat to, specific \n                information is exceptional; and\n                (2) the normal criteria for determining eligibility for \n                access applicable to information classified at the same \n                level are not deemed sufficient to protect the \n                information from unauthorized disclosure; or\n                (3) the program is required by statute.\n\n                    (b) Requirements and Limitations. (1) Special \n                access programs shall be limited to programs in which \n                the number of persons who will have access ordinarily \n                will be reasonably small and commensurate with the \n                objective of providing enhanced protection for the \n                information involved.\n                (2) Each agency head shall establish and maintain a \n                system of accounting for special access programs \n                consistent with directives issued pursuant to this \n                order.\n                (3) Special access programs shall be subject to the \n                oversight program established under section 5.6(c) of \n                this order. In addition, the Director of the \n                Information Security Oversight Office shall be afforded \n                access to these programs, in accordance with the \n                security requirements of each program, in order to \n                perform the functions assigned to the Information \n                Security Oversight Office under this order. An agency \n                head may limit access to a special access program to \n                the Director and no more than one other employee of the \n                Information Security Oversight Office; or, for special \n                access programs that are extraordinarily sensitive and \n                vulnerable, to the Director only.\n                (4) The agency head or principal deputy shall review \n                annually each special access program to determine \n                whether it continues to meet the requirements of this \n                order. [[Page 19838]] \n                (5) Upon request, an agency shall brief the Assistant \n                to the President for National Security Affairs, or his \n                or her designee, on any or all of the agency's special \n                access programs.\n\n                    (c) Within 180 days after the effective date of \n                this order, each agency head or principal deputy shall \n                review all existing special access programs under the \n                agency's jurisdiction. These officials shall terminate \n                any special access programs that do not clearly meet \n                the provisions of this order. Each existing special \n                access program that an agency head or principal deputy \n                validates shall be treated as if it were established on \n                the effective date of this order.\n                    (d) Nothing in this order shall supersede any \n                requirement made by or under 10 U.S.C. 119.\n\n                Sec. 4.5. Access by Historical Researchers and Former \n                Presidential Appointees. (a) The requirement in section \n                4.2(a)(3) of this order that access to classified \n                information may be granted only to individuals who have \n                a need-to-know the information may be waived for \n                persons who:\n\n                (1) are engaged in historical research projects; or\n                (2) previously have occupied policy-making positions to \n                which they were appointed by the President.\n\n                    (b) Waivers under this section may be granted only \n                if the agency head or senior agency official of the \n                originating agency:\n                (1) determines in writing that access is consistent \n                with the interest of national security;\n                (2) takes appropriate steps to protect classified \n                information from unauthorized disclosure or compromise, \n                and ensures that the information is safeguarded in a \n                manner consistent with this order; and\n                (3) limits the access granted to former Presidential \n                appointees to items that the person originated, \n                reviewed, signed, or received while serving as a \n                Presidential appointee.\n\n                PART 5--IMPLEMENTATION AND REVIEW\n\n                Sec. 5.1. Definitions. For purposes of this order: (a) \n                ``Self-inspection'' means the internal review and \n                evaluation of individual agency activities and the \n                agency as a whole with respect to the implementation of \n                the program established under this order and its \n                implementing directives.\n\n                    (b) ``Violation'' means:\n                (1) any knowing, willful, or negligent action that \n                could reasonably be expected to result in an \n                unauthorized disclosure of classified information;\n                (2) any knowing, willful, or negligent action to \n                classify or continue the classification of information \n                contrary to the requirements of this order or its \n                implementing directives; or\n                (3) any knowing, willful, or negligent action to create \n                or continue a special access program contrary to the \n                requirements of this order.\n\n                    (c) ``Infraction'' means any knowing, willful, or \n                negligent action contrary to the requirements of this \n                order or its implementing directives that does not \n                comprise a ``violation,'' as defined above.\n\n                Sec. 5.2.

These directives shall be binding \n                upon the agencies. Directives issued by the Director of \n                the Office of Management and Budget shall establish \n                standards for:\n\n                (1) classification and marking principles;\n                (2) agency security education and training programs;\n                (3) agency self-inspection programs; and\n                (4) classification and declassification guides.\n\n                    (b) The Director of the Office of Management and \n                Budget shall delegate the implementation and \n                monitorship functions of this program to the Director \n                of the Information Security Oversight Office. \n                [[Page 19839]] \n                    (c) The Security Policy Board, established by a \n                Presidential Decision Directive, shall make a \n                recommendation to the President through the Assistant \n                to the President for National Security Affairs with \n                respect to the issuance of a Presidential directive on \n                safeguarding classified information. The Presidential \n                directive shall pertain to the handling, storage, \n                distribution, transmittal, and destruction of and \n                accounting for classified information.\n\n                Sec. 5.3. Information Security Oversight Office. (a) \n                There is established within the Office of Management \n                and Budget an Information Security Oversight Office. \n                The Director of the Office of Management and Budget \n                shall appoint the Director of the Information Security \n                Oversight Office, subject to the approval of the \n                President.\n\n                    (b) Under the direction of the Director of the \n                Office of Management and Budget acting in consultation \n                with the Assistant to the President for National \n                Security Affairs, the Director of the Information \n                Security Oversight Office shall:\n                (1) develop directives for the implementation of this \n                order;\n                (2) oversee agency actions to ensure compliance with \n                this order and its implementing directives;\n                (3) review and approve agency implementing regulations \n                and agency guides for systematic declassification \n                review prior to their issuance by the agency;\n                (4) have the authority to conduct on-site reviews of \n                each agency's program established under this order, and \n                to require of each agency those reports, information, \n                and other cooperation that may be necessary to fulfill \n                its responsibilities.

App.) (the ``Act''), and in order \n                to establish a Commission on United States-Pacific \n                Trade and Investment Policy, it is hereby ordered as \n                follows:\n\n                Section 1. Establishment. (a) There is established the \n                Commission on United States-Pacific Trade and \n                Investment Policy (``Commission''). The Commission \n                shall be composed of 15 members to be appointed by the \n                President. Members shall (1) be chosen from the private \n                sector (businesses, unions, academic institutions, and \n                nonprofit corporations); and (2) have substantial \n                experience with selling agricultural products, \n                manufactured goods, or high-value-added services to \n                Asian and Pacific markets or be knowledgeable from \n                their personal or professional experience about the \n                trade barriers or their industry and government \n                policies and practices, formal and informal, that have \n                restricted access by U.S. business to Asian and Pacific \n                markets.\n\n                    (b) The President shall designate a Chairperson and \n                Vice Chairperson from among the members of the \n                Commission.\n\n                Sec. 2. Functions. (a) On or before February 1, 1996, \n                the Commission shall report to the President on the \n                steps the United States should take to achieve a \n                significant opening of Japan, China, and other Asian \n                and Pacific markets to U.S. business. The report also \n                shall identify trade and investment impediments to U.S. \n                business in Asian and Pacific markets and provide \n                recommendations for reducing the impediments. The \n                report's recommendations shall reflect the goal of \n                securing increased access for U.S. business to Asian \n                and Pacific markets, by the turn of the century, in \n                such a way that a maximum number of high-wage jobs are \n                created and maintained in the United States. The \n                Commission also shall recommend to the President (1) \n                measures to strengthen, if necessary, ongoing programs \n                for regular monitoring of progress toward this goal, \n                including the periodic assessment of the nature and \n                scope of trade and investment impediments; and (2) \n                realistic measurements of trade and investment activity \n                in Asia and the Pacific, which consider all relevant \n                factors, including the composition of trade and \n                intracompany trade and investment patterns.\n\n                    (b) The Commission shall decide by a three-fifths \n                vote which recommendations to include in the report. At \n                the request of any Commission member, the report will \n                include that Commission member's dissenting views or \n                opinions.\n                    (c) The Commission may, for the purpose of carrying \n                out its functions, hold meetings at such times and \n                places as the Commission may find advisable.\n\n                Sec. 3. Administration. (a) To the extent permitted by \n                law, the heads of executive departments, agencies, and \n                independent instrumentalities shall provide the \n                Commission, upon request, with such information as it \n                may require for the purposes of carrying out its \n                functions.\n\n                    (b) Upon request of the Chairperson of the \n                Commission, the head of any Federal agency or \n                instrumentality shall, to the extent permitted by law \n                and subject to the discretion of such head, (1) make \n                any of the facilities and services of such agency or \n                instrumentality available to the Commission; \n                [[Page 33096]] and (2) detail any of the personnel of \n                such agency or instrumentality to the Commission to \n                assist the Commission in carrying out its duties.\n                    (c) Members of the Commission shall serve without \n                compensation for their work on the Commission. While \n                engaged in the work of the Commission, members \n                appointed from the private sector may be allowed travel \n                expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as \n                authorized by law for persons serving intermittently in \n                the Government service (5 U.S.C. 5701-5707) to the \n                extent funds are available for such purposes.\n                    (d) To the extent permitted by law and subject to \n                the availability of appropriations, the Department of \n                Commerce shall provide the Commission with \n                administrative services, facilities, staff, and other \n                support services necessary for performance of the \n                Commission's functions.\n                    (e) The United States Trade Representative shall \n                perform the functions of the President under the Act, \n                except that of reporting to the Congress, in accordance \n                with the guidelines and procedures established by the \n                Administrator of General Services.\n                    (f) The Commission shall adhere to the requirements \n                set forth in the Act. All executive branch officials \n                assigned duties by the Act shall comply with its \n                requirements with respect to the Commission.\n\n                Sec. 4. General Provision. The Commission shall \n                terminate 30 days after submitting its final report.\n\n                    (Presidential Sig.)<clinton1><clinton2>\n\n                THE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n                    June 21, 1995.\n\n[FR Doc. 95-15760\nFiled 6-22-95; 2:39 pm]\nBilling code 3195-01-P\n\n</clinton2></clinton1></pre>]","url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/1995/06/26/95-15760/commission-on-united-states-pacific-trade-and-investment-policy","president":"clinton","id":"12964"},"reftime":1418257581876}

Policy.\n\n                1-101. A growing body of scientific knowledge \n                demonstrates that children may suffer \n                disproportionately from environmental health risks and \n                safety risks. These risks arise because: children's \n                neurological, immunological, digestive, and other \n                bodily systems are still developing; children eat more \n                food, drink more fluids, and breathe more air in \n                proportion to their body weight than adults; children's \n                size and weight may diminish their protection from \n                standard safety features; and children's behavior \n                patterns may make them more susceptible to accidents \n                because they are less able to protect themselves. \n                Therefore, to the extent permitted by law and \n                appropriate, and consistent with the agency's mission, \n                each Federal agency:\n\n                    (a) shall make it a high priority to identify and \n                assess environmental health risks and safety risks that \n                may disproportionately affect children; and\n                    (b) shall ensure that its policies, programs, \n                activities, and standards address disproportionate \n                risks to children that result from environmental health \n                risks or safety risks.\n\n                1-102. Each independent regulatory agency is encouraged \n                to participate in the implementation of this order and \n                comply with its provisions.\n\n                Sec. 2. Definitions. The following definitions shall \n                apply to this order.\n\n                2-201. ``Federal agency'' means any authority of the \n                United States that is an agency under 44 U.S.C. 3502(1) \n                other than those considered to be independent \n                regulatory agencies under 44 U.S.C. 3502(5). For \n                purposes of this order, ``military departments,'' as \n                defined in 5 U.S.C. 102, are covered under the auspices \n                of the Department of Defense.\n\n                2-202. ``Covered regulatory action'' means any \n                substantive action in a rulemaking, initiated after the \n                date of this order or for which a Notice of Proposed \n                Rulemaking is published 1 year after the date of this \n                order, that is likely to result in a rule that may:\n\n                    (a) be ``economically significant'' under Executive \n                Order 12866 (a rulemaking that has an annual effect on \n                the economy of $100 million or more or would adversely \n                affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the \n                economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the \n                environment, public health or safety, or State, local, \n                or tribal governments or communities); and\n                    (b) concern an environmental health risk or safety \n                risk that an agency has reason to believe may \n                disproportionately affect children.\n\n                2-203. ``Environmental health risks and safety risks'' \n                mean risks to health or to safety that are attributable \n                to products or substances that the child is likely to \n                come in contact with or ingest (such as the air we \n                breath, the food we eat, the water we drink or use for \n                recreation, the soil we live on, and the products we \n                use or are exposed to).\n\n                 Sec. 3.

The Task Force shall incorporate agency \n                submissions into its report and ensure that this report \n                is publicly available and widely disseminated. The \n                Office of Science and Technology Policy and the \n                National Science and Technology Council shall ensure \n                that this report is fully considered in establishing \n                research priorities.\n\n                3-306. The Task Force shall exist for a period of 4 \n                years from the first meeting. At least 6 months prior \n                to the expiration of that period, the member agencies \n                shall assess the need for continuation of the Task \n                Force or its functions, and make appropriate \n                recommendations to the President.\n\n                Sec. 4. Research Coordination and Integration.\n\n                4-401. Within 6 months of the date of this order, the \n                Task Force shall develop or direct to be developed a \n                review of existing and planned data resources and a \n                proposed plan for ensuring that researchers and Federal \n                research agencies have access to information on all \n                research conducted or funded by the Federal Government \n                that is related to adverse health risks in children \n                resulting from exposure to environmental health risks \n                or safety risks. The National Science and Technology \n                Council shall review the plan.\n\n                4-402. The plan shall promote the sharing of \n                information on academic and private research. It shall \n                include recommendations to encourage that such data, to \n                the extent permitted by law, is available to the \n                public, the scientific and academic communities, and \n                all Federal agencies.\n\n                Sec. 5. Agency Environmental Health Risk or Safety Risk \n                Regulations.\n\n                5-501. For each covered regulatory action submitted to \n                OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs \n                (OIRA) for review pursuant to Executive Order 12866, \n                the issuing agency shall provide to OIRA the following \n                information developed as part of the agency's \n                decisionmaking process, unless prohibited by law:\n\n                    (a) an evaluation of the environmental health or \n                safety effects of the planned regulation on children; \n                and\n                    (b) an explanation of why the planned regulation is \n                preferable to other potentially effective and \n                reasonably feasible alternatives considered by the \n                agency.\n\n                5-502. In emergency situations, or when an agency is \n                obligated by law to act more quickly than normal review \n                procedures allow, the agency shall comply with the \n                provisions of this section to the extent practicable. \n                For those covered regulatory actions that are governed \n                by a court-imposed or statutory deadline, the agency \n                shall, to the extent practicable, schedule any \n                rulemaking proceedings so as to permit sufficient time \n                for completing the analysis required by this section.\n\n                5-503. The analysis required by this section may be \n                included as part of any other required analysis, and \n                shall be made part of the administrative record for the \n                covered regulatory action or otherwise made available \n                to the public, to the extent permitted by law.\n\n                Sec. 6. Interagency Forum on Child and Family \n                Statistics.\n\n                6-601. The Director of the OMB (``Director'') shall \n                convene an Interagency Forum on Child and Family \n                Statistics (``Forum''), which will include \n                representatives from the appropriate Federal statistics \n                and research agencies. The Forum shall produce an \n                annual compendium (``Report'') of the most important \n                indicators of the well-being of the Nation's children.\n\n                6-602. The Forum shall determine the indicators to be \n                included in each Report and identify the sources of \n                data to be used for each indicator. The\n\n[[Page 19888]]\n\n                Forum shall provide an ongoing review of Federal \n                collection and dissemination of data on children and \n                families, and shall make recommendations to improve the \n                coverage and coordination of data collection and to \n                reduce duplication and overlap.\n\n                6-603. The Report shall be published by the Forum in \n                collaboration with the National Institute of Child \n                Health and Human Development. The Forum shall present \n                the first annual Report to the President, through the \n                Director, by July 31, 1997. The Report shall be \n                submitted annually thereafter, using the most recently \n                available data.\n\n                Sec. 7. General Provisions.\n\n                7-701.

Policy.  It is the policy of the executive \n                branch to establish a smoke-free environment for \n                Federal employees and members of the public visiting or \n                using Federal facilities. The smoking of tobacco \n                products is thus prohibited in all interior space \n                owned, rented, or leased by the executive branch of the \n                Federal Government, and in any outdoor areas under \n                executive branch control in front of air intake ducts.\n\n                Sec. 2. Exceptions.  The general policy established by \n                this order is subject to the following exceptions: (a) \n                The order does not apply in designated smoking areas \n                that are enclosed and exhausted directly to the outside \n                and away from air intake ducts, and are maintained \n                under negative pressure (with respect to surrounding \n                spaces) sufficient to contain tobacco smoke within the \n                designated area. Agency officials shall not require \n                workers to enter such areas during business hours while \n                smoking is ongoing.\n\n                    (b) The order does not extend to any residential \n                accommodation for persons voluntarily or involuntarily \n                residing, on a temporary or long-term basis, in a \n                building owned, leased, or rented by the Federal \n                Government.\n                    (c) The order does not extend to those portions of \n                federally owned buildings leased, rented, or otherwise \n                provided in their entirety to nonfederal parties.\n                    (d) The order does not extend to places of \n                employment in the private sector or in other nonfederal \n                governmental units that serve as the permanent or \n                intermittent duty station of one or more Federal \n                employees.\n                    (e) The head of any agency may establish limited \n                and narrow exceptions that are necessary to accomplish \n                agency missions. Such exception shall be in writing, \n                approved by the agency head, and to the fullest extent \n                possible provide protection of nonsmokers from exposure \n                to environmental tobacco smoke. Authority to establish \n                such exceptions may not be delegated.\n\n                Sec. 3. Other Locations.  The heads of agencies shall \n                evaluate the need to restrict smoking at doorways and \n                in courtyards under executive branch control in order \n                to protect workers and visitors from environmental \n                tobacco smoke, and may restrict smoking in these areas \n                in light of this evaluation.\n\n                Sec. 4. Smoking Cessation Programs.  The heads of \n                agencies are encouraged to use existing authority to \n                establish programs designed to help employees stop \n                smoking.\n\n                Sec. 5. Responsibility for Implementation.  The heads \n                of agencies are responsible for implementing and \n                ensuring compliance with the provisions of this order. \n                ``Agency'' as used in this order means an Executive \n                agency, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105, and includes any \n                employing unit or authority of the Federal Government, \n                other than those of the legislative and judicial \n                branches. Independent agencies are encouraged to comply \n                with the provisions of this order.\n\n                Sec. 6. Phase-In of Implementation.  Implementation of \n                the policy set forth in this order shall be achieved no \n                later than 1 year after the date of this\n\n[[Page 43452]]\n\n                order. This 1 year phase-in period is designed to \n                establish a fixed but reasonable time for implementing \n                this policy. Agency heads are directed during this \n                period to inform all employees and visitors to \n                executive branch facilities about the requirements of \n                this order, inform their employees of the health risks \n                of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, and \n                undertake related activities as necessary.\n\n                Sec. 7. Consistency with Other Laws.  The provisions of \n                this order shall be implemented consistent with \n                applicable law, including the Federal Service Labor-\n                Management Relations Act (5 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.) and \n                the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et \n                seq.) Provisions of existing collective bargaining \n                agreements shall be honored and agencies shall consult \n                with employee labor representatives about the \n                implementation of this order. Nothing herein shall be \n                construed to impair or alter the powers and duties of \n                Federal agencies established under law. Nothing herein \n                shall be construed to replace any agency policy \n                currently in effect, if such policy is legally \n                established, in writing, and consistent with the terms \n                of this order. Agencies shall review their current \n                policy to confirm that agency policy comports with this \n                order, and policy found not in compliance shall be \n                revised to comply with the terms of this order.\n\n                Sec. 8. Cause of Action.  This order does not create \n                any right to administrative or judicial review, or any \n                other right or benefit, substantive or procedural, \n                enforceable by a party against the United States, its \n                agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or \n                employees, or any other person or affect in any way the \n                liability of the executive branch under the Federal \n                Tort Claims Act.\n\n                Sec. 9. Construction.  Nothing in this order shall \n                limit an agency head from establishing more protective \n                policies on smoking in the Federal workplace for \n                employees and members of the public visiting or using \n                Federal facilities.\n\n                    (Presidential Sig.)<clinton1><clinton2>\n\n                THE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n                    August 9, 1997.\n\n[FR Doc. 97-21607\nFiled 8-12-97; 8:45 am]\nBilling code 3195-01-P\n\n\n</clinton2></clinton1></pre>]","url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/1997/08/13/97-21607/protecting-federal-employees-and-the-public-from-exposure-to-tobacco-smoke-in-the-federal-workplace","president":"clinton","id":"13058"},"reftime":1418257593890}

If the \n                Integrity Committee determines that the report requires \n                no further referral or recommendations, it shall so \n                notify the Chairperson of the PCIE/ECIE.\n                    (d) Where the Chairperson of the PCIE/ECIE \n                determines that dissemination of the report to the head \n                of the subject's employing agency or entity is \n                appropriate, the head of the agency or entity shall \n                certify to the Chairperson of the PCIE/ECIE within \n                sixty 60 days that he has personally reviewed the \n                report, what action, if any, has been or is to be \n                taken, and when any action taken will be completed. The \n                PCIE/ECIE Chairperson may grant the head of the entity \n                or agency a 30-day extension when circumstances \n                necessitate such extension.\n                    (e) The Chairperson of the PCIE/ECIE shall report \n                to the Integrity Committee the final disposition of the \n                matter, including what action, if any, has been\n\n[[Page 13045]]\n                or is to be taken by the head of the subject's \n                employing agency or entity. When the Integrity \n                Committee receives notice of the final disposition, it \n                shall advise the subject of the investigation that the \n                matter referred to the Integrity Committee for review \n                has been closed.\n\n                Sec. 5. Procedures. (a) The Integrity Committee, in \n                conjunction with the Chairperson of the PCIE/ECIE, \n                shall establish the policies and procedures necessary \n                to ensure consistency in conducting investigations and \n                reporting activities under this order.\n\n                    (b) Such policies and procedures shall specify the \n                circumstances under which the Integrity Committee, upon \n                review of a complaint containing allegations of \n                wrongdoing, may determine that an allegation is without \n                merit and therefore the investigation is unwarranted. A \n                determination by the Integrity Committee that an \n                investigation is unwarranted shall be considered the \n                Integrity Committee's final disposition of the \n                complaint.\n                    (c) The policies and procedures may be expanded to \n                encompass other issues related to the handling of \n                allegations against IGs and others covered by this \n                order.\n\n                Sec. 6. Records Maintenance. All records created and \n                received pursuant to this order are records of the \n                Integrity Committee and shall be maintained by the FBI.\n\n                Sec. 7. Judicial Review. This order is intended only to \n                improve the internal management of the executive branch \n                and is not intended to create any right or benefit, \n                substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a \n                party against the United States, its agencies, its \n                officers, or any person.\n\n                    (Presidential Sig.)<clinton1><clinton2>\n\n                THE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n                    March 21, 1996.\n\n[FR Doc. 96-7460\nFiled 3-25-96; 8:45 am]\nBilling code 3195-01-P\n\n</clinton2></clinton1></pre>]","url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/1996/03/26/96-7460/administrative-allegations-against-inspectors-general","president":"clinton","id":"12993"},"reftime":1418257585540}

Eligibility Determinations. (a) \n                Determinations of eligibility for access to classified \n                information shall be based on criteria established \n                under this order. Such determinations are separate from \n                suitability determinations with respect to the hiring \n                or retention of persons for employment by the \n                government or any other personnel actions.\n\n                    (b) The number of employees that each agency \n                determines are eligible for access to classified \n                information shall be kept to the minimum required for \n                the conduct of agency functions.\n                    (1) Eligibility for access to classified \n                information shall not be requested or granted solely to \n                permit entry to, or ease of movement within, controlled \n                areas when the employee has no need for access and \n                access to classified information may reasonably be \n                prevented. Where circumstances indicate employees may \n                be inadvertently exposed to classified information in \n                the course of their duties, agencies are authorized to \n                grant or deny, in their discretion, facility access \n                approvals to such employees based on an appropriate \n                level of investigation as determined by each agency.\n                    (2) Except in agencies where eligibility for access \n                is a mandatory condition of employment, eligibility for \n                access to classified information shall only be \n                requested or granted based on a demonstrated, \n                foreseeable need for access. Requesting or approving \n                eligibility in excess of actual requirements is \n                prohibited.\n                    (3) Eligibility for access to classified \n                information may be granted where there is a temporary \n                need for access, such as one-time participation in a \n                classified project, provided the investigative \n                standards established under this order have been \n                satisfied. In such cases, a fixed date or event for \n                expiration shall be identified and access to classified \n                information shall be limited to information related to \n                the particular project or assignment.\n                    (4) Access to classified information shall be \n                terminated when an employee no longer has a need for \n                access.\n\n                Sec. 2.2. Level of Access Approval. (a) The level at \n                which an access approval is granted for an employee \n                shall be limited, and relate directly, to the level of \n                classified information for which there is a need for \n                access. Eligibility for access to a higher level of \n                classified information includes eligibility for access \n                to information classified at a lower level.\n\n                    (b) Access to classified information relating to a \n                special access program shall be granted in accordance \n                with procedures established by the head of the agency \n                that created the program or, for programs pertaining to \n                intelligence activities (including special activities \n                but not including military operational, strategic, and \n                tactical programs) or intelligence sources and methods, \n                by the Director of Central Intelligence. To the extent \n                possible and consistent with the national security \n                interests of the United States, such procedures shall \n                be consistent with the standards and procedures \n                established by and under this order.\n\n                Sec. 2.3 Temporary Access to Higher Levels. (a) An \n                employee who has been determined to be eligible for \n                access to classified information based on favorable \n                adjudication of a completed investigation may be \n                granted temporary access to a higher level where \n                security personnel authorized by the agency head to \n                make access eligibility determinations find that such \n                access: \n\n[[Page 40249]]\n\n\n                    (1) is necessary to meet operational or contractual \n                exigencies not expected to be of a recurring nature;\n                    (2) will not exceed 180 days; and\n                    (3) is limited to specific, identifiable \n                information that is made the subject of a written \n                access record.\n                    (b) Where the access granted under subsection (a) \n                of this section involves another agency's classified \n                information, that agency must concur before access to \n                its information is granted.\n\n                Sec. 2.4. Reciprocal Acceptance of Access Eligibility \n                Determinations. (a) Except when an agency has \n                substantial information indicating that an employee may \n                not satisfy the standards in section 3.1 of this order, \n                background investi-gations and eligibility \n                determinations conducted under this order shall be \n                mutually and reciprocally accepted by all agencies.\n\n                    (b) Except where there is substantial information \n                indicating that the employee may not satisfy the \n                standards in section 3.1 of this order, an employee \n                with existing access to a special access program shall \n                not be denied eligibility for access to another special \n                access program at the same sensitivity level as \n                determined personally by the agency head or deputy \n                agency head, or have an existing access eligibility \n                readjudicated, so long as the employee has a need for \n                access to the information involved.\n                    (c) This section shall not preclude agency heads \n                from establishing additional, but not duplicative, \n                investigative or adjudicative procedures for a special \n                access program or for candidates for detail or \n                assignment to their agencies, where such procedures are \n                required in exceptional circumstances to protect the \n                national security.\n                    (d) Where temporary eligibility for access is \n                granted under sections 2.3 or 3.3 of this order or \n                where the determination of eligibility for access is \n                conditional, the fact of such temporary or conditional \n                access shall be conveyed to any other agency that \n                considers affording the employee access to its \n                information.\n\n                Sec. 2.5. Specific Access Requirement. (a) Employees \n                who have been determined to be eligible for access to \n                classified information shall be given access to \n                classified information only where there is a need-to-\n                know that information.\n\n                    (b) It is the responsibility of employees who are \n                authorized holders of classified information to verify \n                that a prospective recipient's eligibility for access \n                has been granted by an authorized agency official and \n                to ensure that a need-to-know exists prior to allowing \n                such access, and to challenge requests for access that \n                do not appear well-founded.\n\n                Sec. 2.6. Access by Non-United States Citizens. (a) \n                Where there are compelling reasons in furtherance of an \n                agency mission, immigrant alien and foreign national \n                employees who possess a special expertise may, in the \n                discretion of the agency, be granted limited access to \n                classified information only for specific programs, \n                projects, contracts, licenses, certificates, or grants \n                for which there is a need for access. Such individuals \n                shall not be eligible for access to any greater level \n                of classified information than the United States \n                Govern-ment has determined may be releasable to the \n                country of which the subject is currently a citizen, \n                and such limited access may be approved only if the \n                prior 10 years of the subject's life can be \n                appropriately investigated. If there are any doubts \n                concerning granting access, additional lawful \n                investigative procedures shall be fully pursued.\n\n                    (b) Exceptions to these requirements may be \n                permitted only by the agency head or the senior agency \n                official designated under section 6.1 of this order to \n                further substantial national security interests.\n                PART 3--ACCESS ELIGIBILITY STANDARDS\n\n                Sec. 3.1.

A \n                determination of eligibility for access to such \n                information is a discretionary security decision based \n                on judgments by appropriately trained adjudicative \n                personnel. Eligibility shall be granted only where \n                facts and circumstances indicate access to classified \n                information is clearly consistent with the national \n                security interests of the United States, and any doubt \n                shall be resolved in favor of the national security.\n                    (c) The United States Government does not \n                discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, \n                sex, national origin, disability, or sexual orientation \n                in granting access to classified information.\n                    (d) In determining eligibility for access under \n                this order, agencies may investigate and consider any \n                matter that relates to the determination of whether \n                access is clearly consistent with the interests of \n                national security. No inference concerning the \n                standards in this section may be raised solely on the \n                basis of the sexual orientation of the employee.\n                    (e) No negative inference concerning the standards \n                in this section may be raised solely on the basis of \n                mental health counseling. Such counseling can be a \n                positive factor in eligibility determinations. However, \n                mental health counseling, where relevant to the \n                adjudication of access to classified information, may \n                justify further inquiry to determine whether the \n                standards of subsection (b) of this section are \n                satisfied, and mental health may be considered where it \n                directly relates to those standards.\n                    (f) Not later than 180 days after the effective \n                date of this order, the Security Policy Board shall \n                develop a common set of adjudicative guidelines for \n                determining eligibility for access to classified \n                information, including access to special access \n                programs.\n\n                Sec. 3.2. Basis for Eligibility Approval. (a) \n                Eligibility determinations for access to classified \n                information shall be based on information concerning \n                the applicant or employee that is acquired through the \n                investigation conducted pursuant to this order or \n                otherwise available to security officials and shall be \n                made part of the applicant's or employee's security \n                record. Applicants or employees shall be required to \n                provide relevant information pertaining to their \n                background and character for use in investigating and \n                adjudicating their eligibility for access.\n\n                    (b) Not later than 180 days after the effective \n                date of this order, the Security Policy Board shall \n                develop a common set of investigative standards for \n                background investigations for access to classified \n                information. These standards may vary for the various \n                levels of access.\n                    (c) Nothing in this order shall prohibit an agency \n                from utilizing any lawful investigative procedure in \n                addition to the investigative requirements set forth in \n                this order and its implementing regulations to resolve \n                issues that may arise during the course of a background \n                investigation or reinvestigation.\n\n                Sec. 3.3. Special Circumstances. (a) In exceptional \n                circumstances where official functions must be \n                performed prior to the completion of the investigative \n                and adjudication process, temporary eligibility for \n                access to classified information may be granted to an \n                employee while the initial investigation is underway. \n                When such eligibility is granted, the initial \n                investigation shall be expedited. \n\n[[Page 40251]]\n\n\n                    (1) Temporary eligibility for access under this \n                section shall include a justification, and the employee \n                must be notified in writing that further access is \n                expressly conditioned on the favorable completion of \n                the investigation and issuance of an access eligibility \n                approval. Access will be immediately terminated, along \n                with any assignment requiring an access eligibility \n                approval, if such approval is not granted.\n                    (2) Temporary eligibility for access may be granted \n                only by security personnel authorized by the agency \n                head to make access eligibility determinations and \n                shall be based on minimum investigative standards \n                developed by the Security Policy Board not later than \n                180 days after the effective date of this order.\n                    (3) Temporary eligibility for access may be granted \n                only to particular, identified categories of classified \n                information necessary to perform the lawful and \n                authorized functions that are the basis for the \n                granting of temporary access.\n                    (b) Nothing in subsection (a) shall be construed as \n                altering the authority of an agency head to waive \n                requirements for granting access to classified \n                information pursuant to statutory authority.\n                    (c) Where access has been terminated under section \n                2.1(b)(4) of this order and a new need for access \n                arises, access eligibility up to the same level shall \n                be reapproved without further investigation as to \n                employees who were determined to be eligible based on a \n                favorable adjudication of an investigation completed \n                within the prior 5 years, provided they have remained \n                employed by the same employer during the period in \n                question, the employee certifies in writing that there \n                has been no change in the relevant information provided \n                by the employee for the last background investigation, \n                and there is no information that would tend to indicate \n                the employee may no longer satisfy the standards \n                established by this order for access to classified \n                information.\n                    (d) Access eligibility shall be reapproved for \n                individuals who were determined to be eligible based on \n                a favorable adjudication of an investigation completed \n                within the prior 5 years and who have been retired or \n                otherwise separated from United States Government \n                employment for not more than 2 years; provided there is \n                no indication the individual may no longer satisfy the \n                standards of this order, the individual certifies in \n                writing that there has been no change in the relevant \n                information provided by the individual for the last \n                background investigation, and an appropriate record \n                check reveals no unfavorable information.\n\n                Sec. 3.4. Reinvestigation Requirements. (a) Because \n                circumstances and characteristics may change \n                dramatically over time and thereby alter the \n                eligibility of employees for continued access to \n                classified information, reinvestigations shall be \n                conducted with the same priority and care as initial \n                investigations.\n\n                    (b) Employees who are eligible for access to \n                classified information shall be the subject of periodic \n                reinvestigations and may also be reinvestigated if, at \n                any time, there is reason to believe that they may no \n                longer meet the standards for access established in \n                this order.\n                    (c) Not later than 180 days after the effective \n                date of this order, the Security Policy Board shall \n                develop a common set of reinvestigative standards, \n                including the frequency of reinvestigations.\n                PART 4--INVESTIGATIONS FOR FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS\n\n                Sec. 4. Authority. Agencies that conduct background \n                investigations, including the Federal Bureau of \n                Investigation and the Department of State, are \n                authorized to conduct personnel security investigations \n                in the United States when requested by a foreign \n                government as part of its own personnel security \n                program and with the consent of the individual.\n \n[[Page 40252]]\n\n\n                PART 5--REVIEW OF ACCESS DETERMINATIONS\n\n                Sec. 5.1. Determinations of Need for Access. A \n                determination under section 2.1(b)(4) of this order \n                that an employee does not have, or no longer has, a \n                need for access is a discretionary determination and \n                shall be conclusive.\n\n                Sec. 5.2. Review Proceedings for Denials or Revocations \n                of Eligibility for Access. (a) Applicants and employees \n                who are determined to not meet the standards for access \n                to classified information established in section 3.1 of \n                this order shall be:\n\n                    (1) provided as comprehensive and detailed a \n                written explanation of the basis for that conclusion as \n                the national security interests of the United States \n                and other applicable law permit;\n                    (2) provided within 30 days, upon request and to \n                the extent the documents would be provided if requested \n                under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) or \n                the Privacy Act (3 U.S.C. 552a), as applicable, any \n                documents, records, and reports upon which a denial or \n                revocation is based;\n                    (3) informed of their right to be represented by \n                counsel or other representative at their own expense; \n                to request any documents, records, and reports as \n                described in section 5.2(a)(2) upon which a denial or \n                revocation is based; and to request the entire \n                investigative file, as permitted by the national \n                security and other applicable law, which, if requested, \n                shall be promptly provided prior to the time set for a \n                written reply;\n                    (4) provided a reasonable opportunity to reply in \n                writing to, and to request a review of, the \n                determination;\n                    (5) provided written notice of and reasons for the \n                results of the review, the identity of the deciding \n                authority, and written notice of the right to appeal;\n                    (6) provided an opportunity to appeal in writing to \n                a high level panel, appointed by the agency head, which \n                shall be comprised of at least three members, two of \n                whom shall be selected from outside the security field. \n                Decisions of the panel shall be in writing, and final \n                except as provided in subsection (b) of this section; \n                and\n                    (7) provided an opportunity to appear personally \n                and to present relevant documents, materials, and \n                information at some point in the process before an \n                adjudicative or other authority, other than the \n                investigating entity, as determined by the agency head. \n                A written summary or recording of such appearance shall \n                be made part of the applicant's or employee's security \n                record, unless such appearance occurs in the presence \n                of the appeals panel described in subsection (a)(6) of \n                this section.\n                    (b) Nothing in this section shall prohibit an \n                agency head from personally exercising the appeal \n                authority in subsection (a)(6) of this section based \n                upon recommendations from an appeals panel. In such \n                case, the decision of the agency head shall be final.\n                    (c) Agency heads shall promulgate regulations to \n                implement this section and, at their sole discretion \n                and as resources and national security considerations \n                permit, may provide additional review proceedings \n                beyond those required by subsection (a) of this \n                section. This section does not require additional \n                proceedings, however, and creates no procedural or \n                substantive rights.\n                    (d) When the head of an agency or principal deputy \n                personally certifies that a procedure set forth in this \n                section cannot be made available in a particular case \n                without damaging the national security interests of the \n                United States by revealing classified information, the \n                particular procedure shall not be made available. This \n                certification shall be conclusive.\n                    (e) This section shall not be deemed to limit or \n                affect the responsibility and power of an agency head \n                pursuant to any law or other Executive order to deny or \n                terminate access to classified information in the \n                interests \n\n[[Page 40253]]\n                of national security. The power and responsibility to deny or terminate \n                access to classified information pursuant to any law or \n                other Executive order may be exercised only where the \n                agency head determines that the procedures prescribed \n                in subsection (a) of this section cannot be invoked in \n                a manner that is consistent with national security. \n                This determination shall be conclusive.\n                    (f)(1) This section shall not be deemed to limit or \n                affect the responsibility and power of an agency head \n                to make determinations of suitability for employment.\n                    (2) Nothing in this section shall require that an \n                agency provide the procedures prescribed in subsection \n                (a) of this section to an applicant where a conditional \n                offer of employment is withdrawn for reasons of \n                suitability or any other reason other than denial of \n                eligibility for access to classified information.\n                    (3) A suitability determination shall not be used \n                for the purpose of denying an applicant or employee the \n                review proceedings of this section where there has been \n                a denial or revocation of eligibility for access to \n                classified information.\n                PART 6--IMPLEMENTATION\n\n                Sec. 6.1.

Policies.\n\n                    (a) The American Heritage Rivers initiative has \n                three objectives: natural resource and environmental \n                protection, economic revitalization, and historic and \n                cultural preservation.\n                    (b) Executive agencies (``agencies''), to the \n                extent permitted by law and consistent with their \n                missions and resources, shall coordinate Federal plans, \n                functions, programs, and resources to preserve, \n                protect, and restore rivers and their associated \n                resources important to our history, culture, and \n                natural heritage.\n                    (c) Agencies shall develop plans to bring increased \n                efficiencies to existing and authorized programs with \n                goals that are supportive of protection and restoration \n                of communities along rivers.\n                    (d) In accordance with Executive Order 12630, \n                agencies shall act with due regard for the protection \n                of private property provided for by the Fifth Amendment \n                to the United States Constitution. No new regulatory \n                authority is created as a result of the American \n                Heritage Rivers initiative. This initiative will not \n                interfere with matters of State, local, and tribal \n                government jurisdiction.\n                    (e) In furtherance of these policies, the President \n                will designate rivers that meet certain criteria as \n                ``American Heritage Rivers.''\n                    (f) It is the policy of the Federal Government that \n                communities shall nominate rivers as American Heritage \n                Rivers and the Federal role will be solely to support \n                community-based efforts to preserve, protect, and \n                restore these rivers and their communities.\n                    (g) Agencies should, to the extent practicable, \n                help identify resources in the private and nonprofit \n                sectors to aid revitalization efforts.\n                    (h) Agencies are encouraged, to the extent \n                permitted by law, to develop partnerships with State, \n                local, and tribal governments and community and \n                nongovernmental organizations. Agencies will be \n                responsive to the diverse needs of different kinds of \n                communities from the core of our cities to remote rural \n                areas and shall seek to ensure that the role played by \n                the Federal Government is complementary to the plans \n                and work being carried out by State, local, and tribal \n                governments. To the extent possible, Federal resources \n                will be strategically directed to complement resources \n                being spent by these governments.\n                    (i) Agencies shall establish a method for field \n                offices to assess the success of the American Heritage \n                River initiative and provide a means to recommend \n                changes that will improve the delivery and \n                accessibility of Federal services and programs. \n                Agencies are directed, where appropriate, to reduce and \n                make more flexible procedural requirements and \n                paperwork related to providing assistance to \n                communities along designated rivers.\n\n[[Page 48446]]\n\n                    (j) Agencies shall commit to a policy under which \n                they will seek to ensure that their actions have a \n                positive effect on the natural, historic, economic, and \n                cultural resources of American Heritage River \n                communities. The policy will require agencies to \n                consult with American Heritage River communities early \n                in the planning stages of Federal actions, take into \n                account the communities' goals and objectives and \n                ensure that actions are compatible with the overall \n                character of these communities. Agencies shall seek to \n                ensure that their help for one community does not \n                adversely affect neighboring communities. Additionally, \n                agencies are encouraged to develop formal and informal \n                partnerships to assist communities. Local Federal \n                facilities, to the extent permitted by law and \n                consistent with the agencies' missions and resources, \n                should provide public access, physical space, technical \n                assistance, and other support for American Heritage \n                River communities.\n                    (k) In addition to providing support to designated \n                rivers, agencies will work together to provide \n                information and services to all communities seeking \n                support.\n\n                Sec. 2. Process for Nominating an American Heritage \n                River.\n\n                    (a) Nomination. Communities, in coordination with \n                their State, local, or tribal governments, can nominate \n                their river, river stretch, or river confluence for \n                designation as an American Heritage River. When several \n                communities are involved in the nomination of the same \n                river, nominations will detail the coordination among \n                the interested communities and the role each will play \n                in the process. Individuals living outside the \n                community may not nominate a river.\n                    (b) Selection Criteria. Nominations will be judged \n                based on the following:\n                    (1) the characteristics of the natural, economic, \n                agricultural, scenic, historic, cultural, or \n                recreational resources of the river that render it \n                distinctive or unique;\n                    (2) the effectiveness with which the community has \n                defined its plan of action and the extent to which the \n                plan addresses, either through planned actions or past \n                accomplishments, all three American Heritage Rivers \n                objectives, which are set forth in section 1(a) of this \n                order;\n                    (3) the strength and diversity of community support \n                for the nomination as evidenced by letters from elected \n                officials; landowners; private citizens; businesses; \n                and especially State, local, and tribal governments. \n                Broad community support is essential to receiving the \n                American Heritage River designation; and\n                    (4) willingness and capability of the community to \n                forge partnerships and agreements to implement their \n                plan to meet their goals and objectives.\n                    (c) Recommendation Process.\n                    The Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality \n                (``CEQ'') shall develop a fair and objective procedure \n                to obtain the views of a diverse group of experts for \n                the purpose of making recommendations to the President \n                as to which rivers shall be designated. These experts \n                shall reflect a variety of viewpoints, such as those \n                representing natural, cultural, and historic resources; \n                scenic, environmental, and recreation interests; \n                tourism, transportation, and economic development \n                interests; and industries such as agriculture, \n                hydropower, manufacturing, mining, and forest \n                management. The Chair of the CEQ will ensure that the \n                rivers recommended represent a variety of stream sizes, \n                diverse geographical locations, and a wide range of \n                settings from urban to rural and ensure that relatively \n                pristine, successful revitalization efforts are \n                considered as well as degraded rivers in need of \n                restoration.\n                    (d) Designation.\n                    (1) The President will designate certain rivers as \n                American Heritage Rivers.

Human Health and Environmental Data \n                Collection and Analysis. To the extent permitted by \n                existing law, including the Privacy Act, as amended (5 \n                U.S.C. section 552a): (a) each Federal agency, whenever \n                practicable and appropriate, shall collect, maintain, \n                and analyze information assessing and comparing \n                environmental and human health risks borne by \n                populations identified by race, national origin, or \n                income. To the extent practical and appropriate, \n                Federal agencies shall use this information to \n                determine whether their programs, policies, and \n                activities have disproportionately high and adverse \n                human health or environmental effects on minority \n                populations and low-income populations;\n                    (b) In connection with the development and \n                implementation of agency strategies in section 1-103 of \n                this order, each Federal agency, whenever practicable \n                and appropriate, shall collect, maintain and analyze \n                information on the race, national origin, income level, \n                and other readily accessible and appropriate \n                information for areas surrounding facilities or sites \n                expected to have a substantial environmental, human \n                health, or economic effect on the surrounding \n                populations, when such facilities or sites become the \n                subject of a substantial Federal environmental \n                administrative or judicial action. Such information \n                shall be made available to the public, unless \n                prohibited by law; and\n                    (c) Each Federal agency, whenever practicable and \n                appropriate, shall collect, maintain, and analyze \n                information on the race, national origin, income level, \n                and other readily accessible and appropriate \n                information for areas surrounding Federal facilities \n                that are: (1) subject to the reporting requirements \n                under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-\n                Know Act, 42 U.S.C. section 11001-11050 as mandated in \n                Executive Order No. 12856; and (2) expected to have a \n                substantial environmental, human health, or economic \n                effect on surrounding populations. Such information \n                shall be made available to the public, unless \n                prohibited by law.\n                    (d) In carrying out the responsibilities in this \n                section, each Federal agency, whenever practicable and \n                appropriate, shall share information and eliminate \n                unnecessary duplication of efforts through the use of \n                existing data systems and cooperative agreements among \n                Federal agencies and with State, local, and tribal \n                governments.\n\n                Sec. 4-4.

We need to ensure \n                that we continue to train Federal employees to take \n                full advantage of these technological advances and to \n                acquire the skills and learning needed to succeed in a \n                changing workplace. A coordinated Federal effort is \n                needed to provide flexible training opportunities to \n                employees and to explore how Federal training programs, \n                initiatives, and policies can better support lifelong \n                learning through the use of learning technology.\n\n                To help us meet these goals, I am creating a task force \n                on Federal training technology, directing Federal \n                agencies to take certain steps to enhance employees' \n                training opportunities through the use of training \n                technology, and an advisory committee on the use of \n                training technology, which also will explore options \n                for financing the training and post-secondary education \n                needed to upgrade skills and gain new knowledge.\n\n                Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President \n                by the Constitution and the laws of the United States \n                of America, including the Federal Advisory Committee \n                Act, as amended (5 U.S.C.

Establishment of the President's Task Force \n                on Federal Training Technology. (a) The ``President's \n                Task Force on Federal Training Technology'' (Task \n                Force) is established. The Task Force shall provide \n                leadership regarding the effective use of technology in \n                training and education; make training opportunities an \n                integral part of continuing employment in the Federal \n                Government; and facilitate the ongoing coordination of \n                Federal activities concerning the use of technology in \n                training. The Task Force shall consist of the heads of \n                the following departments and agencies or their \n                representatives: the Departments of State, the \n                Treasury, Defense, Justice, Interior, Agriculture, \n                Commerce, Labor, Health and Human Services, Housing and \n                Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, and \n                Education; the Office of Personnel Management, General \n                Services Administration, Environmental Protection \n                Agency, National Aeronautics and Space and \n                Administration, Small Business Administration, and \n                Social Security Administration; a representative from \n                the Small Agency Council; and representatives from \n                other relevant agencies and related Federal councils, \n                as determined by the Chair and Vice Chair of the Task \n                Force.\n\n                    (b) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the \n                head of each agency or council shall designate a senior \n                official to serve as a representative to the Task \n                Force. The representative shall report directly to the \n                agency head or the President's Management Council \n                member on the agency's or council's activities under \n                this order.\n\n[[Page 2794]]\n\n                    (c) The Director of the Office of Personnel \n                Management (OPM) shall be the Chair and the \n                representative from the Department of Labor shall be \n                the Vice Chair of the Task Force.\n                    (d) The Chair and Vice Chair shall appoint an \n                Executive Director.\n                    (e) The Task Force member agencies shall provide \n                any required staffing and funding, as appropriate.\n\n                Sec. 2. Duties of the Task Force. (a) Within 18 months \n                of the date of this order, the Task Force shall develop \n                and recommend to the President, through the Assistant \n                to the President for Economic Policy and the Assistant \n                to the President for Science and Technology, a policy \n                to make effective use of technology to improve training \n                opportunities for Federal Government employees. The \n                policy should promote and integrate the effective use \n                of training technologies to create affordable and \n                convenient training opportunities to improve Federal \n                employee performance. The Task Force shall seek the \n                views of experts from industry, academia, and State and \n                local governments as the Task Force proceeds, as \n                appropriate. Specifically, the Task Force shall:\n\n                    L   (1) develop strategies to improve the \n                efficiency and availability of training opportunities \n                for Federal Government employees;\n                    L   (2) form partnerships among key Federal \n                agencies, State and local governments, businesses, \n                universities, and other appropriate entities to promote \n                the development and use of high-quality training \n                opportunities;\n                    L   (3) analyze the use of technology in existing \n                training programs and policies of the Task Force member \n                agencies to determine what changes, modifications, and \n                innovations may be necessary to advance training \n                opportunities;\n                    L   (4) in consultation with the Department of \n                Defense and the National Institute of Standards and \n                Technology, recommend standards for training software \n                and associated services purchased by Federal agencies \n                and contractors. These standards should be consistent \n                with voluntary industry consensus-based commercial \n                standards. Agencies, where appropriate, should use \n                these standards in procurements to promote reusable \n                training component software and thereby reduce \n                duplication in the development of courseware;\n                    L   (5) evaluate and, where appropriate, coordinate \n                and collaborate on, research and demonstration \n                activities of Task Force member agencies related to \n                Federal training technology;\n                    L   (6) identify and support cross-agency training \n                areas that would particularly benefit from new \n                instructional technologies and facilitate multiagency \n                procurement and use of training materials, where \n                appropriate;\n                    L   (7) in consultation with the General Services \n                Administration, the Office of Personnel Management, and \n                the Office of Federal Procurement Policy of the Office \n                of Management and Budget (OFPP), promote existing and \n                new procurement vehicles that allow agencies to provide \n                innovative training opportunities for Federal \n                employees;\n                    L   (8) recommend changes that may be needed to \n                existing procurement laws to further the objectives of \n                this order and forward the recommendations to the \n                Administrator of OFPP; and\n                    (b) develop options and recommendations for \n                establishing a Federal Individual Training Account for \n                each Federal worker for training relevant to his or her \n                Federal employment. To the extent permitted by law, \n                such accounts may be established with the funds \n                allocated to the agency for employee training. Approval \n                for training would be within the discretion of the \n                individual employee's manager. Options and \n                recommendations shall be reported no later than 6 \n                months from the date of this order.\n\n                Sec. 3. Duties of All Federal Agencies. (a) Each \n                Federal agency shall, to the extent permitted by law:\n\n[[Page 2795]]\n\n                    L   (1) include as part of its annual budget \n                process a set of goals to provide the highest quality \n                and most efficient training opportunities possible to \n                its employees, and a set of performance measures of the \n                quality and availability of training opportunities \n                possible to its employees. Such measures should be, \n                where appropriate, based on outcomes related to \n                performance rather than time allocation;\n                    L   (2) identify the resources necessary to achieve \n                the aforementioned goals and performance measures \n                articulated in its annual performance plan;\n                    L   (3) and, where practicable, use the standards \n                recommended by the Task Force and published by the \n                Office of Personnel Management for purchasing training \n                software and associated services; and\n                    L   (4) subject to the availability of \n                appropriations, post training courses, information, and \n                other learning opportunities on the Department of \n                Labor's America's Learning Exchange (ALX), or other \n                appropriate information dissemination vehicles as \n                determined by the Task Force, to make information about \n                Federal training courses, information, and other \n                learning opportunities widely available to Federal \n                employees.\n                    (b) Each Federal agency, to the extent permitted by \n                law, is encouraged to consider how savings achieved \n                through the efficient use of training technology can be \n                reinvested in improved training for their employees.\n\n                Sec. 4.

The Secretary, in consultation with the \n                Commission, shall submit to the President an Annual \n                Federal Plan to Promote Hispanic American Educational \n                Excellence (Annual Federal Plan, or Plan). All actions \n                described in the Plan shall be designed to help \n                Hispanic Americans attain the educational improvement \n                targets set forth in the National Education Goals and \n                any standards established by the National Education \n                Standards and Improvement Council. The Plan shall \n                include data on eligibility for, and participation by, \n                Hispanic Americans in Federal education programs, and \n                such other aspects of the educational status of \n                Hispanic Americans as the Secretary considers \n                appropriate. This Plan also shall include, as an \n                appendix, the text of the agency plans described in \n                section 6 of this order. The Secretary, in consultation \n                with the Commission and with the assistance of the \n                Initiative staff, shall ensure that superintendents of \n                Hispanic-serving school districts, presidents of \n                Hispanic-serving institutions of higher education, \n                directors of educational programs for Hispanic \n                Americans, and other appropriate individuals are given \n                the opportunity to comment on the proposed Annual \n                Federal Plan. For purposes of this order, a ``Hispanic-\n                serving'' school district or institution of higher \n                education is any local education agency or institution \n                of higher education, respectively, whose student \n                population is more than 25 percent Hispanic.\n\n                Sec. 6. As part of the development of the Annual \n                Federal Plan, each Executive department and each \n                designated agency (hereinafter in this section referred \n                to collectively as ``agency'') shall prepare a plan \n                for, and shall document, both that agency's effort to \n                increase Hispanic American participation in Federal \n                education programs where Hispanic Americans currently \n                are underserved, and that agency's effort to improve \n                educational outcomes for Hispanic Americans \n                participating in Federal education programs. This plan \n                shall address, among other relevant issues: (a) the \n                elimination of unintended regulatory barriers to \n                Hispanic American participation in Federal education \n                programs; (b) the adequacy of announcements of program \n                opportunities of interest to Hispanic-serving school \n                districts, institutions of higher education, and \n                agencies; and (c) ways of eliminating educational \n                inequalities and disadvantages faced by Hispanic \n                Americans. It also shall emphasize the facilitation of \n                technical, planning, and development advice to \n                Hispanic-serving school districts and institutions of \n                higher education. Each agency's plan shall provide \n                appropriate measurable objectives for proposed actions \n                aimed at increasing Hispanic American participation in \n                Federal education programs where Hispanic Americans \n                currently are underserved. After the first year, each \n                agency's plan also shall assess that agency's \n                performance on the goals set in the previous year's \n                annual plan. These plans shall be submitted by a date \n                and time to be established by the Secretary.\n\n                Sec. 7. The Director of the Office of Personnel \n                Management, in consultation with the Secretary and the \n                Secretary of Labor, to the extent permitted by law, \n                shall develop a program to promote recruitment of \n                Hispanic students for part-time, summer, and permanent \n                positions in the Federal Government.\n\n                Sec. 8. I have determined that the Commission shall be \n                established in compliance with the Federal Advisory \n                Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. App. 2). \n                Notwithstanding any other Executive order, the \n                responsibilities of the President under the Federal \n                Advisory Committee Act, as amended, shall be performed \n                by the Secretary, in accordance with the guidelines and \n                procedures established by the Administrator of General \n                Services.\n\n                Sec. 9. Administration. (a) Members of the Commission \n                shall serve without compensation, but shall be allowed \n                travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of \n                subsistence, as authorized by law for persons serving \n                intermittently in the Government service (5 U.S.C. \n                5701-5707).\n\n                    (b) The Commission and the Initiative shall obtain \n                funding for their activities from the Department of \n                Education.\n                    (c) The Department of Education shall provide such \n                administrative services for the Commission as may be \n                required.\n\n                Sec. 10.

Minimizing the Y2K problem will require a major \n                technological and managerial effort, and it is critical \n                that the United States Government do its part in \n                addressing this challenge.\n\n                Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President \n                by the Constitution and the laws of the United States \n                of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:\n\n                Section 1. Policy. (a) It shall be the policy of the \n                executive branch that agencies shall:\n\n                    (1) assure that no critical Federal program \n                experiences disruption because of the Y2K problem;\n                    (2) assist and cooperate with State, local, and \n                tribal governments to address the Y2K problem where \n                those governments depend on Federal information or \n                information technology or the Federal Government is \n                dependent on those governments to perform critical \n                missions;\n                    (3) cooperate with the private sector operators of \n                critical national and local systems, including the \n                banking and financial system, the telecommunications \n                system, the public health system, the transportation \n                system, and the electric power generation system, in \n                addressing the Y2K problem; and\n                    (4) communicate with their foreign counterparts to \n                raise awareness of and generate cooperative \n                international arrangements to address the Y2K problem.\n                    (b) As used in this order, ``agency'' and \n                ``agencies'' refer to Federal agencies that are not in \n                the judicial or legislative branches.\n\n                Sec. 2.

CLINTON, President of the United States \n                of America, in view of the policies underlying \n                Executive Order 12938 of November 14, 1994, and \n                Executive Order 13085 of May 26, 1998, find that the \n                risk of nuclear proliferation created by the \n                accumulation of a large volume of weapons-usable \n                fissile material in the territory of the Russian \n                Federation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary \n                threat to the national security and foreign policy of \n                the United States, and hereby declare a national \n                emergency to deal with that threat.\n\n                I hereby order:\n\n                Section 1. A major national security goal of the United \n                States is to ensure that fissile material removed from \n                Russian nuclear weapons pursuant to various arms \n                control and disarmament agreements is dedicated to \n                peaceful uses, subject to transparency measures, and \n                protected from diversion to activities of proliferation \n                concern. As reflected in Executive Order 13085, the \n                full implementation of the Agreement Between the \n                Government of the United States of America and the \n                Government of the Russian Federation Concerning the \n                Disposition of Highly Enriched Uranium Extracted from \n                Nuclear Weapons, dated February 18, 1993, and related \n                contracts and agreements (collectively, the ``HEU \n                Agreements'') is essential to the attainment of this \n                goal. The HEU Agreements provide for the conversion of \n                approximately 500 metric tons of highly enriched \n                uranium contained in Russian nuclear weapons into low-\n                enriched uranium for use as fuel in commercial nuclear \n                reactors. In furtherance of our national security \n                goals, all heads of departments and agencies of the \n                United States Government shall continue to take all \n                appropriate measures within their authority to further \n                the full implementation of the HEU Agreements.\n\n                Sec. 2. Government of the Russian Federation assets \n                directly related to the implementation of the HEU \n                Agreements currently may be subject to attachment, \n                judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or \n                other judicial process, thereby jeopardizing the full \n                implementation of the HEU Agreements to the detriment \n                of U.S. foreign policy. In order to ensure the \n                preservation and proper and complete transfer to the \n                Government of the Russian Federation of all payments \n                due to it under the HEU Agreements, and except to the \n                extent provided in regulations, orders, directives, or \n                licenses that may hereafter be issued pursuant to this \n                order, all property and interests in property of the \n                Government of the Russian Federation directly related \n                to the implementation of the HEU Agreements that are in \n                the United States, that hereafter come within the \n                United States, or that are or hereafter come within the \n                possession or control of United States persons, \n                including their overseas branches, are hereby blocked \n                and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, \n                or otherwise dealt in.

The \n                Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and the Information \n                Technology Management Reform Act of 1996 provide the \n                opportunity to improve significantly the way the \n                Federal Government acquires and manages information \n                technology.

Establishment of Effective Written \n                Procedures to Facilitate the Provision of Reasonable \n                Accommodation. (a) Each Federal agency shall establish \n                effective written procedures for processing requests \n                for reasonable accommodation by employees and \n                applicants with disabilities.

If the agency requires an \napplicant or employee to complete a reasonable accommodation request form \nfor recordkeeping purposes, the form must be provided as an attachment to \nthe agency's written procedures;\n\n(2) Explain how the agency will process a request for reasonable \naccommodation, and from whom the individual will receive a final decision;\n\n(3) Designate a time period during which reasonable accommodation requests \nwill be granted or denied, absent extenuating circumstances. Time limits \nfor decision making should be as short as reasonably possible;\n\n(4) Explain the responsibility of the employee or applicant to provide \nappropriate medical information related to the functional impairment at \nissue and the requested accommodation where the disability and/or need for \naccommodation is not obvious;\n\n(5) Explain the agency's right to request relevant supplemental medical \ninformation if the information submitted does not clearly explain the \nnature of the disability, or the need for the reasonable accommodation, or \ndoes not otherwise clarify how the requested accommodation will assist the \nemployee to perform the essential functions of the job or to enjoy the \nbenefits and privileges of the workplace;\n\n(6) Explain the agency's right to have medical information reviewed by a \nmedical expert of the agency's choosing at the agency's expense;\n\n(7) Provide that reassignment will be considered as a reasonable \naccommodation if the agency determines that no other reasonable \naccommodation will permit the employee with a disability to perform the \nessential functions of his or her current position;\n\n(8) Provide that reasonable accommodation denials be in writing and specify \nthe reasons for denial;\n\n[[Page 46566]]\n\n(9) Ensure that agencies' systems of recordkeeping track the processing of \nrequests for reasonable accommodation and maintain the confidentiality of \nmedical information received in accordance with applicable law and \nregulations; and\n\n(10) Encourage the use of informal dispute resolution processes to allow \nindividuals with disabilities to obtain prompt reconsideration of denials \nof reasonable accommodation. Agencies must also inform individuals with \ndisabilities that they have the right to file complaints in the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity process and other statutory processes, as \nappropriate, if their requests for reasonable accommodation are denied.\n\n                Sec. 2.

Within 1 year from the date of this \n                order, each agency shall submit its procedures to the \n                EEOC. Each agency shall also submit to the EEOC any \n                modifications to its reasonable accommodation \n                procedures at the time that those modifications are \n                adopted.\n\n                Sec. 3. Collective Bargaining Obligations. In adopting \n                their reasonable accommodation procedures, agencies \n                must honor their obligations to notify their collective \n                bargaining representatives and bargain over such \n                procedures to the extent required by law.\n\n                Sec. 4. Implementation. The EEOC shall issue guidance \n                for the implementation of this order within 90 days \n                from the date of this order.\n\n                Sec. 5.

Definitions. For purposes of this order:\n\n                    (a) ``State'' or ``States'' refer to the States of \n                the United States of America, individually or \n                collectively, and, where relevant, to State \n                governments, including units of local government and \n                other political subdivisions established by the States.\n                    (b) ``Policies that have federalism implications'' \n                refers to Federal regulations, proposed legislation, \n                and other policy statements or actions that have \n                substantial direct effects on the States or on the \n                relationship, or the distribution of power and \n                responsibilities, between the Federal Government and \n                the States.\n                    (c) ``Agency'' means any authority of the United \n                States that is an ``agency'' under 44 U.S.C. 3502(1), \n                other than those considered to be independent \n                regulatory agencies, as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(5).\n\n                Sec. 2. Fundamental Federalism Principles. In \n                formulating and implementing policies that have \n                federalism implications, agencies shall be guided by \n                the following fundamental federalism principles:\n\n                    (a) The structure of government established by the \n                Constitution is premised upon a system of checks and \n                balances.\n                    (b) The Constitution created a Federal Government \n                of supreme, but limited, powers. The sovereign powers \n                not granted to the Federal Government are reserved to \n                the people or to the States, unless prohibited to the \n                States by the Constitution.\n                    (c) Federalism reflects the principle that dividing \n                power between the Federal Government and the States \n                serves to protect individual liberty. Preserving State \n                authority provides an essential balance to the power of \n                the Federal Government, while preserving the supremacy \n                of Federal law provides an essential balance to the \n                power of the States.\n                    (d) The people of the States are at liberty, \n                subject only to the limitations in the Constitution \n                itself or in Federal law, to define the moral, \n                political, and legal character of their lives.\n                    (e) Our constitutional system encourages a healthy \n                diversity in the public policies adopted by the people \n                of the several States according to their own \n                conditions, needs, and desires. States and local \n                governments are often uniquely situated to discern the \n                sentiments of the people and to govern accordingly.\n                    (f) Effective public policy is often achieved when \n                there is competition among the several States in the \n                fashioning of different approaches to public policy \n                issues. The search for enlightened public policy is \n                often furthered when individual States and local \n                governments are free to experiment with a variety of \n                approaches to public issues. Uniform, national \n                approaches to\n\n[[Page 27652]]\n\n                public policy problems can inhibit the creation of \n                effective solutions to those problems.\n                    (g) Policies of the Federal Government should \n                recognize the responsibility of--and should encourage \n                opportunities for--States, local governments, private \n                associations, neighborhoods, families, and individuals \n                to achieve personal, social, environmental, and \n                economic objectives through cooperative effort.\n\n                Sec. 3. Federalism Policymaking Criteria. In addition \n                to adhering to the fundamental federalism principles \n                set forth in section 2 of this order, agencies shall \n                adhere, to the extent permitted by law, to the \n                following criteria when formulating and implementing \n                policies that have federalism implications:\n\n                    (a) There should be strict adherence to \n                constitutional principles. Agencies should closely \n                examine the constitutional and statutory authority \n                supporting any Federal action that would limit the \n                policymaking discretion of States and local \n                governments, and should carefully assess the necessity \n                for such action.\n                    (b) Agencies may limit the policymaking discretion \n                of States and local governments only after determining \n                that there is constitutional and legal authority for \n                the action.\n                    (c) With respect to Federal statutes and \n                regulations administered by States and local \n                governments, the Federal Government should grant States \n                and local governments the maximum administrative \n                discretion possible. Any Federal oversight of such \n                State and local administration should not unnecessarily \n                intrude on State and local discretion.\n                    (d) It is important to recognize the distinction \n                between matters of national or multi-state scope (which \n                may justify Federal action) and matters that are merely \n                common to the States (which may not justify Federal \n                action because individual States, acting individually \n                or together, may effectively deal with them). Matters \n                of national or multi-state scope that justify Federal \n                action may arise in a variety of circumstances, \n                including:\n                    (1) When the matter to be addressed by Federal \n                action occurs interstate as opposed to being contained \n                within one State's boundaries.\n                    (2) When the source of the matter to be addressed \n                occurs in a State different from the State (or States) \n                where a significant amount of the harm occurs.\n                    (3) When there is a need for uniform national \n                standards.\n                    (4) When decentralization increases the costs of \n                government thus imposing additional burdens on the \n                taxpayer.\n                    (5) When States have not adequately protected \n                individual rights and liberties.\n                    (6) When States would be reluctant to impose \n                necessary regulations because of fears that regulated \n                business activity will relocate to other States.\n                    (7) When placing regulatory authority at the State \n                or local level would undermine regulatory goals because \n                high costs or demands for specialized expertise will \n                effectively place the regulatory matter beyond the \n                resources of State authorities.\n                    (8) When the matter relates to Federally owned or \n                managed property or natural resources, trust \n                obligations, or international obligations.\n                    (9) When the matter to be regulated significantly \n                or uniquely affects Indian tribal governments.\n\n                Sec. 4. Consultation. (a) Each agency shall have an \n                effective process to permit elected officials and other \n                representatives of State and local governments to \n                provide meaningful and timely input in the development \n                of regulatory policies that have federalism \n                implications.\n\n                    (b) To the extent practicable and permitted by law, \n                no agency shall promulgate any regulation that is not \n                required by statute, that has federalism implica-\n\n[[Page 27653]]\n\n                tions, and that imposes substantial direct compliance \n                costs on States and local governments, unless:\n                    L  (1) funds necessary to pay the direct costs \n                incurred by the State or local government in complying \n                with the regulation are provided by the Federal \n                Government; or\n                    L  (2) the agency, prior to the formal promulgation \n                of the regulation,\n\n                L  (A) in a separately identified portion of the \n                preamble to the regulation as it is to be issued in the \n                Federal Register, provides to the Director of the \n                Office of Management and Budget a description of the \n                extent of the agency's prior consultation with \n                representatives of affected States and local \n                governments, a summary of the nature of their concerns, \n                and the agency's position supporting the need to issue \n                the regulation; and\n                L  (B) makes available to the Director of the Office of \n                Management and Budget any written communications \n                submitted to the agency by States or local governments.\n\n                Sec. 5. Increasing Flexibility for State and Local \n                Waivers. (a) Agencies shall review the processes under \n                which States and local governments apply for waivers of \n                statutory and regulatory requirements and take \n                appropriate steps to streamline those processes.\n\n                    (b) Each agency shall, to the extent practicable \n                and permitted by law, consider any application by a \n                State or local government for a waiver of statutory or \n                regulatory requirements in connection with any program \n                administered by that agency with a general view toward \n                increasing opportunities for utilizing flexible policy \n                approaches at the State or local level in cases in \n                which the proposed waiver is consistent with applicable \n                Federal policy objectives and is otherwise appropriate.\n                    (c) Each agency shall, to the extent practicable \n                and permitted by law, render a decision upon a complete \n                application for a waiver within 120 days of receipt of \n                such application by the agency. If the application for \n                a waiver is not granted, the agency shall provide the \n                applicant with timely written notice of the decision \n                and the reasons therefor.\n                    (d) This section applies only to statutory or \n                regulatory requirements that are discretionary and \n                subject to waiver by the agency.\n\n                Sec. 6. Independent Agencies. Independent regulatory \n                agencies are encouraged to comply with the provisions \n                of this order.\n\n                Sec. 7. General Provisions. (a) This order is intended \n                only to improve the internal management of the \n                executive branch and is not intended to, and does not, \n                create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, \n                enforceable at law or equity by a party against the \n                United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its \n                officers or employees, or any other person.\n\n                    (b) This order shall supplement but not supersede \n                the requirements contained in Executive Order 12866 \n                (``Regulatory Planning and Review''), Executive Order \n                12988 (``Civil Justice Reform''), and OMB Circular A-\n                19.\n                    (c) Executive Order 12612 of October 26, 1987, and \n                Executive Order 12875 of October 26, 1993, are revoked.\n                    (d) The consultation and waiver provisions in \n                sections 4 and 5 of this order shall complement the \n                Executive order entitled, ``Consultation and \n                Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments,'' being \n                issued on this day.\n\n[[Page 27654]]\n\n                    (e) This order shall be effective 90 days after the \n                date of this order.\n\n                    (Presidential Sig.)<clinton1><clinton2>\n\n                THE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n                    May 14, 1998.\n\n[FR Doc. 98-13552\nFiled 5-19-98; 11:24 am]\nBilling code 3195-01-P\n\n\n</clinton2></clinton1></pre>]","url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/1998/05/19/98-13552/federalism","president":"clinton","id":"13083"},"reftime":1418257597020}

Establishment. There is hereby established \n                the American Heritage Rivers Initiative Advisory \n                Committee (``Committee''). The Committee shall consist \n                of up to 20 members appointed by the President from the \n                public and private sectors.

The \n                expertise of members of the Committee shall be in areas \n                such as natural, cultural, and historic resources; \n                water quality; public health; scenic and recreation \n                interests; tourism and economic development interests; \n                industry; and agriculture.

The National Performance \n                Review has recommended that the executive branch \n                develop, in cooperation with State, local, and tribal \n                governments, and the private sector, a coordinated \n                National Spatial Data Infrastructure to support public \n                and private sector applications of geospatial data in \n                such areas as transportation, community development, \n                agriculture, emergency response, environmental \n                management, and information technology.\n\n                NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as \n                President by the Constitution and the laws of the \n                United States of America; and to implement the \n                recommendations of the National Performance Review; to \n                advance the goals of the National Information \n                Infrastructure; and to avoid wasteful duplication of \n                effort and promote effective and economical management \n                of resources by Federal, State, local, and tribal \n                governments, it is ordered as follows:\n\n                Section 1. Definitions. (a) ``National Spatial Data \n                Infrastructure'' (``NSDI'') means the technology, \n                policies, standards, and human resources necessary to \n                acquire, process, store, distribute, and improve \n                utilization of geospatial data.\n\n                    (b) ``Geospatial data'' means information that \n                identifies the geographic location and characteristics \n                of natural or constructed features and boundaries on \n                the earth. This information may be derived from, among \n                other things, remote sensing, mapping, and surveying \n                technologies. Statistical data may be included in this \n                definition at the discretion of the collecting agency.\n                    (c) The ``National Geospatial Data Clearinghouse'' \n                means a distributed network of geospatial data \n                producers, managers, and users linked electronically.\n\n                Sec. 2. Executive Branch Leadership for Development of \n                the Coordinated National Spatial Data Infrastructure. \n                (a) The Federal Geographic Data Committee (``FGDC''), \n                established by the Office of Management and Budget \n                (``OMB'') Circular No. A-16 (``Coordination of \n                Surveying, Mapping, and Related Spatial Data \n                Activities'') and chaired by the Secretary of the \n                Department of the Interior (``Secretary'') or the \n                Secretary's designee, shall coordinate the Federal \n                Government's development of the NSDI.\n\n                    (b) Each member agency shall ensure that its \n                representative on the FGDC holds a policy-level \n                position.\n                    (c) Executive branch departments and agencies \n                (``agencies'') that have an interest in the development \n                of the NSDI are encouraged to join the FGDC.\n                    (d) This Executive order is intended to strengthen \n                and enhance the general policies described in OMB \n                Circular No. A-16. Each agency shall meet its \n                respective responsibilities under OMB Circular No. A-\n                16.\n                    (e) The FGDC shall seek to involve State, local, \n                and tribal governments in the development and \n                implementation of the initiatives contained in this \n                order. The FGDC shall utilize the expertise of \n                academia, the private sector, professional societies, \n                and others as necessary to aid in the development and \n                implementation of the objectives of this order.\n\n                Sec. 3. Development of a National Geospatial Data \n                Clearinghouse. (a) Establishing a National Geospatial \n                Data Clearinghouse. The Secretary, through the FGDC, \n                and in consultation with, as appropriate, State, local, \n                and tribal governments and other affected parties, \n                shall take steps within 6 months of the date of this \n                order, to establish an electronic National Geospatial \n                Data Clearinghouse (``Clearinghouse'') for the NSDI. \n                The Clearinghouse shall be compatible with the National \n                Information Infrastructure to enable integration with \n                that effort.\n\n                    (b) Standardized Documentation of Data. Beginning 9 \n                months from the date of this order, each agency shall \n                document all new geospatial data it collects or \n                produces, either directly or indirectly, using the \n                standard under development by the FGDC, and make that \n                standardized documentation electronically accessible to \n                the Clearinghouse network. Within 1 year of the date of \n                this order, agencies shall adopt a schedule, developed \n                in consultation with the FGDC, for documenting, to the \n                extent practicable, geospatial data previously \n                collected or produced, either directly or indirectly, \n                and making that data documentation electronically \n                accessible to the Clearinghouse network.\n                    (c) Public Access to Geospatial Data. Within 1 year \n                of the date of this order, each agency shall adopt a \n                plan, in consultation with the FGDC, establishing \n                procedures to make geospatial data available to the \n                public, to the extent permitted by law, current \n                policies, and relevant OMB circulars, including OMB \n                Circular No. A-130 (``Management of Federal Information \n                Resources'') and any implementing bulletins.\n                    (d) Agency Utilization of the Clearinghouse. Within \n                1 year of the date of this order, each agency shall \n                adopt internal procedures to ensure that the agency \n                accesses the Clearinghouse before it expends Federal \n                funds to collect or produce new geospatial data, to \n                determine whether the information has already been \n                collected by others, or whether cooperative efforts to \n                obtain the data are possible.\n                    (e) Funding. The Department of the Interior shall \n                provide funding for the Clearinghouse to cover the \n                initial prototype testing, standards development, and \n                monitoring of the performance of the Clearinghouse. \n                Agencies shall continue to fund their respective \n                programs that collect and produce geospatial data; such \n                data is then to be made part of the Clearinghouse for \n                wider accessibility.\n\n                Sec. 4. Data Standards Activities. (a) General FGDC \n                Responsibility. The FGDC shall develop standards for \n                implementing the NSDI, in consultation and cooperation \n                with State, local, and tribal governments, the private \n                and academic sectors, and, to the extent feasible, the \n                international community, consistent with OMB Circular \n                No. A-119 (``Federal Participation in the Development \n                and Use of Voluntary Standards''), and other applicable \n                law and policies.\n\n                    (b) Standards for Which Agencies Have Specific \n                Responsibilities. Agencies assigned responsibilities \n                for data categories by OMB Circular No. A-16 shall \n                develop, through the FGDC, standards for those data \n                categories, so as to ensure that the data produced by \n                all agencies are compatible.\n                    (c) Other Standards. The FGDC may from time to time \n                identify and develop, through its member agencies, and \n                to the extent permitted by law, other standards \n                necessary to achieve the objectives of this order. The \n                FGDC will promote the use of such standards and, as \n                appropriate, such standards shall be submitted to the \n                Department of Commerce for consideration as Federal \n                Information Processing Standards. Those standards shall \n                apply to geospatial data as defined in section 1 of \n                this order.\n                    (d) Agency Adherence to Standards. Federal agencies \n                collecting or producing geospatial data, either \n                directly or indirectly (e.g. through grants, \n                partnerships, or contracts with other entities), shall \n                ensure, prior to obligating funds for such activities, \n                that data will be collected in a manner that meets all \n                relevant standards adopted through the FGDC process.\n\n                Sec. 5. National Digital Geospatial Data Framework. In \n                consultation with State, local, and tribal governments \n                and within 9 months of the date of this order, the FGDC \n                shall submit a plan and schedule to OMB for completing \n                the initial implementation of a national digital \n                geospatial data framework (``framework'') by January \n                2000 and for establishing a process of ongoing data \n                maintenance. The framework shall include geospatial \n                data that are significant, in the determination of the \n                FGDC, to a broad variety of users within any geographic \n                area or nationwide. At a minimum, the plan shall \n                address how the initial transportation, hydrology, and \n                boundary elements of the framework might be completed \n                by January 1998 in order to support the decennial \n                census of 2000.\n\n                Sec. 6. Partnerships for Data Acquisition. The \n                Secretary, under the auspices of the FGDC, and within 9 \n                months of the date of this order, shall develop, to the \n                extent permitted by law, strategies for maximizing \n                cooperative participatory efforts with State, local, \n                and tribal governments, the private sector, and other \n                nonfederal organizations to share costs and improve \n                efficiencies of acquiring geospatial data consistent \n                with this order.\n\n                Sec. 7. Scope. (a) For the purposes of this order, the \n                term ``agency'' shall have the same meaning as the term \n                ``Executive agency'' in 5 U.S.C. 105, and shall include \n                the military departments and components of the \n                Department of Defense.\n\n                    (b) The following activities are exempt from \n                compliance with this order:\n                (i) national security-related activities of the \n                Department of Defense as determined by the Secretary of \n                Defense;\n\n                (ii) national defense-related activities of the \n                Department of Energy as determined by the Secretary of \n                Energy; and\n\n                (iii) intelligence activities as determined by the \n                Director of Central Intelligence.\n\n                    (c) The NSDI may involve the mapping, charting, and \n                geodesy activities of the Department of Defense \n                relating to foreign areas, as determined by the \n                Secretary of Defense.\n                    (d) This order does not impose any requirements on \n                tribal governments.\n                    (e) Nothing in the order shall be construed to \n                contravene the development of Federal Information \n                Processing Standards and Guidelines adopted and \n                promulgated under the provisions of section 111(d) of \n                the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of \n                1949, as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987 \n                (Public Law 100-235), or any other United States law, \n                regulation, or international agreement.\n\n                Sec. 8. Judicial Review. This order is intended only to \n                improve the internal management of the executive branch \n                and is not intended to, and does not, create any right \n                to administrative or judicial review, or any other \n                right or benefit or trust responsibility, substantive \n                or procedural, enforceable by a party against the \n                United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its \n                officers or employees, or any other person.\n\n                    (Presidential Sig.)<clinton1>&gt;<clinton2>\n\n\n                THE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n                    April 11, 1994.\n\n[FR Doc. 94-9117\nFiled 4-12-94; 11:32 am]\nBilling code 3195-01-P\n\n\n</clinton2></clinton1></pre>]","url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/1994/04/13/94-9117/coordinating-geographic-data-acquisition-and-access-the-national-spatial-data-infrastructure","president":"clinton","id":"12906"},"reftime":1418257574033}

(a) The Interagency Task Force on the Roles \n                and Missions of the United States Coast Guard is \n                established.\n\n                    (b) The Task Force shall be composed of one \n                representative from the:\n                    (1) Department of State;\n                    (2) Department of Defense;\n                    (3) Department of Justice;\n                    (4) Department of Commerce;\n                    (5) Department of Labor;\n                    (6) Department of Transportation;\n                    (7) Environmental Protection Agency;\n                    (8) Office of Management and Budget;\n                    (9) National Security Council;\n                    (10) Council on Environmental Quality;\n                    (11) Office of Cabinet Affairs;\n                    (12) National Economic Council;\n                    (13) Domestic Policy Council; and\n                    (14) United States Coast Guard.\n\n                The Secretary of Transportation shall select from among \n                the Task Force members a Chair and Vice Chair for the \n                Task Force.\n\n                    (c) The members of the Task Force shall be \n                officials or employees of the Federal Government.\n\n                Sec. 2. Functions. (a) The Task Force shall report to \n                the President through the Secretary of Transportation, \n                and shall provide advice and recommendations regarding \n                the appropriate roles and missions for the United \n                States Coast Guard through the Year 2020. While the \n                Task Force will comprehensively review all Coast Guard \n                roles and missions, it will give special attention to \n                the deepwater missions, which are those that generally \n                occur beyond 50 nautical miles from U.S. shores.\n\n                    (b) The Chair shall consult with the Secretary of \n                Transportation, Commandant of the Coast Guard, and, as \n                appropriate, other heads of departments and agencies. \n                The Chair may invite experts to submit information to \n                the Task Force and hold field briefings or visits.\n                    (c) The Chair may acquire services or form teams to \n                carry out the functions of the Task Force. The Task \n                Force and/or the Task Force staff may travel as \n                necessary to carry out the Task Force's functions.\n\n                Sec. 3. Methodology. (a) The Task Force will seek to \n                identify and distinguish which Coast Guard roles, \n                missions, and functions might be added or enhanced; \n                might be maintained at current levels of performance; \n                or might be reduced, eliminated, or moved to other \n                private organizations or Government agencies. The Task \n                Force also will consider whether current Coast\n\n[[Page 15284]]\n\n                Guard roles, missions, and functions might be better \n                performed by private organizations (by contract or \n                otherwise), public authorities, local or State \n                governments, or other Federal agencies. The Task Force \n                will provide explicit reasons for its recommendations.\n\n                    (b) The Task Force will establish explicit criteria \n                for screening roles, missions, and functions to \n                determine how and by whom they would be best performed.\n                    (c) For those roles, missions, and functions that \n                the Task Force recommends be performed by the Coast \n                Guard, the Task Force will advise as to how they might \n                be performed most effectively and efficiently.\n                    (d) The Task Force will consider the impact on \n                Coast Guard roles, missions, and functions of future \n                prospects in various areas, including technology, \n                demographics, the law of the sea, marine pollution, and \n                national security.\n                    (e) The Task Force shall review each of the Coast \n                Guard's law enforcement and national security missions \n                and functions according to the methodology described in \n                this section. However, in conducting that review, the \n                Task Force shall assume that the Coast Guard will \n                remain a law enforcement agency and an armed force of \n                the United States.\n\n                Sec. 4. Administration. (a) The heads of executive \n                departments and agencies shall, to the extent permitted \n                by law, provide the Task Force such information with \n                respect to the roles and missions of the Coast Guard as \n                it may require to carry out its functions.\n\n                    (b) The Coast Guard shall support the Task Force \n                administratively and financially.\n                    (c) The Secretary of Transportation shall appoint a \n                Staff Director for the Task Force.\n                    (d) Assigned staff shall possess a balanced and \n                broad base of experience to include persons of \n                experience in national security, military operations, \n                foreign and domestic policy, international affairs, \n                economic policy, environmental protection, and law \n                enforcement. Staff members may include military members \n                on active duty, Reserve members of any component, and \n                Federal civilian employees.\n\n                Sec. 5. General. (a) The Task Force shall exist for a \n                period of 6 months from its first meeting unless \n                extended by the Secretary of Transportation and, at the \n                conclusion, submit a written report as discussed in \n                section 2 of this order.\n\n                    (b) The recommendations of the Task Force will be \n                considered in determining the appropriate level of \n                investment in the Coast Guard's Deepwater Capability \n                Replacement Project, a system of cutters and aircraft \n                with an integrated command, control, communications, \n                and sensor infrastructure. The Task Force may provide \n                an interim report for use in preparation of the Federal \n                budget for Fiscal Year 2001.\n\n                    (Presidential Sig.)<clinton1><clinton2>\n\n                THE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n                    March 25, 1999.\n\n[FR Doc. 99-7999\nFiled 3-29-99; 11:01 am]\nBilling code 3195-01-P\n\n\n</clinton2></clinton1></pre>]","url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/1999/03/30/99-7999/interagency-task-force-on-the-roles-and-missions-of-the-united-states-coast-guard","president":"clinton","id":"13115"},"reftime":1418257601305}

Functions. (a) The Commission shall collect and \n                review information about changes in the tobacco farming \n                economy and Federal, State, and local initiatives \n                intended to help tobacco growers, tobacco quota \n                holders, and communities dependent on tobacco \n                production pursue new economic opportunities. The \n                Commission may make recommendations concerning these, \n                and any other, changes and initiatives that may be \n                necessary to improve economic opportunity in \n                communities dependent on tobacco production. It shall \n                also consider the public health implications of such \n                changes and initiatives, including the efforts to \n                reduce youth smoking and tobacco-related health \n                consequences in the United States and abroad.\n\n                    (b) For the purpose of carrying out its functions, \n                the Commission may hold hearings, establish \n                subcommittees, and convene and act at such times and \n                places as the Commission may find advisable.\n\n                Sec. 4.

Federal Leadership and Goals. (a) The \n                purpose of this order is to ensure that the Federal \n                Government exercise leadership in the use of \n                alternative fueled vehicles (AFVs). To that end, each \n                Federal agency shall develop and implement aggressive \n                plans to fulfill the alternative fueled vehicle \n                acquisition requirements established by the Act. The \n                Act generally requires that, of the vehicles acquired \n                by each agency for its fleets, subject to certain \n                conditions specified in section 303(b)(1) of the Act, \n                25 percent should be AFVs in fiscal year (FY) 1996, 33 \n                percent in FY 1997, 50 percent in FY 1998, and 75 \n                percent in FY 1999 and thereafter. These requirements \n                apply to all agencies, regardless of whether they lease \n                vehicles from the General Services Administration (GSA) \n                or acquire them elsewhere. That section also defines \n                which Federal agency vehicles are covered by the AFV \n                acquisition requirements; this order applies to the \n                same vehicles, which are primarily general-use vehicles \n                located in metropolitan statistical areas with \n                populations of 250,000 or more.\n\n                    (b) To the extent practicable, agencies shall use \n                alternative fuels in all vehicles capable of using \n                them. Agencies shall continue to work together in \n                interagency committees recommended by the Federal Fleet \n                Conversion Task Force established by Executive Order \n                12844 of April 21, 1993, to coordinate their vehicle \n                acquisitions and placement.\n\n                Sec. 2. Submission of Agency Plans and Reports on \n                Statutory Compliance. (a) Sixty (60) days after the \n                date of this Executive order, and annually thereafter \n                as part of its budget submission to the Director of the \n                Office of Management and Budget, each agency shall \n                submit a report on its compliance with sections 303 and \n                304 of the Act. A copy of the report shall also be \n                submitted to the Secretary of Energy and to the \n                Administrator of General Services. The report shall \n                state whether the agency is in compliance with the Act, \n                and substantiate that statement with quantitative data \n                including numbers and types of vehicles acquired and \n                the level of their use. At a minimum, the report shall \n                indicate the number of vehicles acquired or converted \n                for each fuel type and vehicle class, and the total \n                number of vehicles of each fuel type operated by the \n                agency. The Director of the Office of Management and \n                Budget shall issue further reporting guidance as \n                necessary.\n\n                    (b) If an agency has failed to meet the statutory \n                requirements, it shall include in its report an \n                explanation for such failure and a plan, consistent \n                with the agency's current and requested budgets, for \n                achieving compliance with the Act. The plan shall \n                include alternative sources of suitable AFVs if the \n                agency's primary vehicle supplier is unable to meet the \n                AFV requirements.\n\n[[Page 66530]]\n\n                    (c) The Secretary of the Department of Energy and \n                the Administrator of General Services shall \n                cooperatively analyze the agency AFV reports and \n                acquisition plans, and shall submit jointly a summary \n                report to the Director of the Office of Management and \n                Budget.\n\n                Sec. 3. Exceptions for Law-Enforcement, Emergency, and \n                National Defense Vehicles. Section 303 of the Act \n                allows exemptions to the acquisition requirements for \n                law-enforcement, emergency, and vehicles acquired and \n                used for military purposes that the Secretary of \n                Defense has certified must be exempt for national \n                security reasons. Law enforcement vehicles shall \n                include vehicles used for protective activities. Each \n                agency that acquires or utilizes any such vehicles \n                shall include in its report an explanation of why an \n                exemption is claimed with respect to such vehicles.\n\n                Sec. 4. Fulfilling the Acquisition Requirement. (a) \n                Agencies may acquire alternative fueled vehicles to \n                meet the requirements of this order through lease from \n                GSA, acquisition of original equipment manufacturer \n                models, commercial lease, conversion of conventionally \n                fueled vehicles, or any combination of these \n                approaches. All vehicles, including those converted for \n                alternative fuel use, shall comply with all applicable \n                Federal and State emissions and safety standards.\n\n                    (b) Based on its own plans and the plans and \n                reports submitted by other agencies, the Administrator \n                of General Services shall provide planning information \n                to potential AFV suppliers to assist in production \n                planning. After consulting with AFV suppliers, the \n                Administrator of General Services shall provide to \n                Federal agencies information on the production plans of \n                AFV suppliers well in advance of budget and ordering \n                cycles.\n                    (c) As required by section 305 of the Act, the \n                Secretary of Energy, in cooperation with the \n                Administrator of General Services, shall continue to \n                provide technical assistance to other Federal agencies \n                that acquire alternative fueled vehicles and shall \n                facilitate the coordination of the Federal Government's \n                alternative fueled vehicle program.\n\n                Sec. 5. Vehicle Reporting Credits. The gains in air \n                quality and energy security that this order seeks to \n                achieve will be even larger if medium- and heavy-duty \n                vehicles are operated on alternative fuels, and if \n                ``zero-emissions vehicles'' (ZEVs) are used. Therefore, \n                for the purposes of this order, agencies may acquire \n                medium- or heavy-duty dedicated alternative fueled \n                vehicles or ZEVs to meet their AFV acquisition \n                requirements, and they shall be given credits for \n                compliance with their AFV targets as follows. Each \n                medium-duty and ZEV shall count the same as two light-\n                duty AFVs, and each dedicated alternative fueled heavy-\n                duty vehicle shall count as three light-duty AFVs. The \n                ZEV credits may be combined with vehicle size credits. \n                The Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in \n                consultation with the Secretary of Energy, shall issue \n                detailed guidance on the classification and reporting \n                of medium-duty, heavy-duty, and ZEVs. In the reports \n                mandated in section 2 of this order, medium- and heavy-\n                duty AFVs and ZEVs shall be identified separately from \n                light-duty vehicles.\n\n                Sec. 6. Funding Alternative Fueled Vehicle Acquisition. \n                (a) The Department of Energy will no longer request or \n                require specific appropriations to fund the incremental \n                costs of alternative fueled vehicles, including any \n                incremental costs associated with acquisition and \n                disposal, for other agencies. Agencies shall formulate \n                their compliance plans based on existing and requested \n                funds, but shall not be exempt from the requirements of \n                the Act or this order due to limited appropriations.\n\n                    (b) An exception regarding funding assistance shall \n                be made for electric vehicles, which are in an earlier \n                stage of development than other alternative fueled \n                vehicles. The Secretary of Energy shall establish a \n                program beginning in FY 1997 to provide partial funding \n                assistance for agency purchases of electric vehicles. \n                Up to $10,000 or one-half the incremental cost over a \n                comparable gasoline-powered vehicle, whichever is less, \n                may be provided as funding assistance for each electric \n                vehicle, subject to the availability of funds.\n\n[[Page 66531]]\n\n                Sec. 7. Agency Cooperation with Stakeholders on \n                Alternative Fueled Vehicle Placement and Refueling \n                Capabilities. The Secretary of Energy shall work with \n                agencies procuring AFVs to coordinate the placement of \n                their vehicles with the placement of similar vehicles \n                by nonfederal alternative fuel stakeholders. Federal \n                planning and acquisition efforts shall be coordinated \n                with the efforts of the Department of Energy's ``Clean \n                Cities'' participants, private industry fuel suppliers, \n                and fleet operators, and State and local governments to \n                ensure that adequate private sector refueling \n                capabilities exist or will exist wherever Federal fleet \n                alternative fueled vehicles are located. Each agency's \n                fleet managers shall work with appropriate \n                organizations at their respective locations, whether in \n                a ``Clean Cities'' location or not, on initiatives to \n                promote alternative fueled vehicle use and expansion of \n                refueling infrastructure.\n\n                Sec. 8. Definitions. For the purpose of this order, the \n                terms ``agency,'' ``alternative fueled vehicle,'' and \n                ``alternative fuel'' have the same meaning given such \n                terms in sections 151 and 301 of the Act.\n\n                Sec. 9. Executive Order 12844. This order supersedes \n                Executive Order 12844.\n\n                Sec. 10. Judicial Review. This order is not intended \n                to, and does not, create any right or benefit or trust \n                responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable \n                by a party against the United States, its agencies or \n                instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any \n                other person.\n\n                    (Presidential Sig.)<clinton1><clinton2>\n\n                THE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n                     December 13, 1996.\n\n[FR Doc. 96-32195\nFiled 12-16-96; 11:26 am]\nBilling code 3195-01-P\n\n\n</clinton2></clinton1></pre>]","url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/1996/12/17/96-32195/federal-alternative-fueled-vehicle-leadership","president":"clinton","id":"13031"},"reftime":1418257590436}

Policy. By its accession to the World Trade \n                Organization, the People's Republic of China will be \n                required to open its markets to a wide range of \n                products and services provided by Americans. In \n                addition, the United States has recently enacted a new \n                law to facilitate trade with the countries of Sub-\n                Saharan Africa and the Caribbean Basin. Federal \n                agencies should take steps to assist small businesses, \n                including businesses headed by underserved populations, \n                in capitalizing on these new opportunities.

Establishment of President's Council on Food \n                Safety. (a) There is established the President's \n                Council on Food Safety (``Council''). The Council shall \n                comprise the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, \n                Health and Human Services, the Director of the Office \n                of Management and Budget (OMB), the Administrator of \n                the Environmental Protection Agency, the Assistant to \n                the President for Science and Technology/Director of \n                the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the \n                Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and the \n                Director of the National Partnership for Reinventing \n                Government. The Council shall consult with other \n                Federal agencies and State, local, and tribal \n                government agencies, and consumer, producer, \n                scientific, and industry groups, as appropriate.\n\n                    (b) The Secretaries of Agriculture and of Health \n                and Human Services and the Assistant to the President \n                for Science and Technology/Director of the Office of \n                Science and Technology Policy shall serve as Joint \n                Chairs of the Council.\n\n                Sec. 2. Purpose. The purpose of the Council shall be to \n                develop a comprehensive strategic plan for Federal food \n                safety activities, taking into consideration the \n                findings and recommendations of the National Academy of \n                Sciences report ``Ensuring Safe Food from Production to \n                Consumption'' and other input from the public on how to \n                improve the effectiveness of the current food safety \n                system. The Council shall make recommendations to the \n                President on how to advance Federal efforts to \n                implement a comprehensive science-based strategy to \n                improve the safety of the food supply and to enhance \n                coordination among Federal agencies, State, local, and \n                tribal governments, and the private sector. The Council \n                shall advise Federal agencies in setting priority areas \n                for investment in food safety.\n\n                Sec. 3. Specific Activities and Functions. (a) The \n                Council shall develop a comprehensive strategic Federal \n                food safety plan that contains specific recommendations \n                on needed changes, including measurable outcome goals. \n                The principal goal of the plan should be the \n                establishment of a seamless, science-based food safety \n                system. The plan should address the steps necessary to \n                achieve this goal, including the key public health, \n                resource, and management issues regarding food safety. \n                The planning process should consider both short-term \n                and long-term issues including new and emerging threats \n                and the special needs of vulnerable populations such as \n                children and the elderly. In developing this plan, the \n                Council shall consult with all interested parties, \n                including State and local agencies, tribes, consumers, \n                producers, industry, and academia.\n\n                    (b) Consistent with the comprehensive strategic \n                Federal food safety plan described in section 3(a) of \n                this order, the Council shall advise agencies of \n                priority areas for investment in food safety and ensure \n                that Federal agencies annually develop coordinated food \n                safety budgets for submission to the OMB that sustain \n                and strengthen existing capacities, eliminate \n                duplication, and ensure the most effective use of \n                resources for improving food\n\n[[Page 45662]]\n\n                safety. The Council shall also ensure that Federal \n                agencies annually develop a unified budget for \n                submission to the OMB for the President's Food Safety \n                Initiative and such other food safety issues as the \n                Council determines appropriate.\n                    (c) The Council shall ensure that the Joint \n                Institute for Food Safety Research (JIFSR), in \n                consultation with the National Science and Technology \n                Council, establishes mechanisms to guide Federal \n                research efforts toward the highest priority food \n                safety needs. The JIFSR shall report to the Council on \n                a regular basis on its efforts: (i) to develop a \n                strategic plan for conducting food safety research \n                activities consistent with the President's Food Safety \n                Initiative and such other food safety activities as the \n                JIFSR determines appropriate; and (ii) to coordinate \n                efficiently, within the executive branch and with the \n                private sector and academia, all Federal food safety \n                research.\n\n                Sec. 4. Cooperation. All actions taken by the Council \n                shall, as appropriate, promote partnerships and \n                cooperation with States, tribes, and other public and \n                private sector efforts wherever possible to improve the \n                safety of the food supply.\n\n                Sec. 5. General Provisions. This order is intended only \n                to improve the internal management of the executive \n                branch and is not intended to, nor does it, create any \n                right or benefit, substantive or procedural, \n                enforceable at law by a party against the United \n                States, its agencies, its officers or any person. \n                Nothing in this order shall affect or alter the \n                statutory responsibilities of any Federal agency \n                charged with food safety responsibilities.\n\n                    (Presidential Sig.)<clinton1><clinton2>\n\n                THE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n                    August 25, 1998.\n\n[FR Doc. 98-23258\nFiled 8-26-98; 8:45 am]\nBilling code 3195-01-P\n\n\n</clinton2></clinton1></pre>]","url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/1998/08/27/98-23258/presidents-council-on-food-safety","president":"clinton","id":"13100"},"reftime":1418257599366}

McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement Program\n\nAGENCY: Department of Education.\n\nACTION: Final regulations.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSUMMARY: The Secretary establishes regulations to govern the Ronald E. \nMcNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement Program (McNair). The regulations \nare needed to implement statutory changes made to the McNair program by \nthe Higher Education Amendments of 1992 and the Higher Education \nTechnical Amendments Act of 1993. These regulations also codify those \npolicies and practices that have been used in the requirements \ngoverning the program for the past four years. Previously, the McNair \nprogram has been administered using only the program statute and the \nEducation Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR).\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE: These regulations take effect on or before October 11, \n1994 or later if the Congress takes certain adjournments, except that \ncompliance is not required with the information collection requirements \nin Sec. 647.21, 647.22, and 647.32 until the information collection \nrequirements contained in these sections have been submitted by the \nDepartment of Education and approved by the Office of Management and \nBudget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. If you want to know \nthe effective date of these regulations, call or write the Department \nof Education contact person. A document announcing the effective date \nwill be published in the Federal Register.\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Eileen S. Bland, U.S. Department of \nEducation, 400 Maryland Avenue, S.W., Room 5065, Washington, D.C. \n20202-5249. Telephone: (202) 708-4804. Individuals who use a \ntelecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal \nInformation Relay Service (FIRS) at 1-800-877-8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 \np.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The purposes and allowable activities of the \nMcNair program support the National Education Goals. Specifically, the \nprogram funds projects designed to increase the number of United States \nundergraduate and graduate students, especially minorities, who \ncomplete advanced degrees in numerous disciplines, including the fields \nof mathematics and science, and the proportion of graduates equipped \nwith the capacity for advanced critical analysis and problem solving.\n    On December 2, 1993, the Secretary published a notice of proposed \nrulemaking (NPRM) for the McNair program in the Federal Register (58 FR \n63870). In this notice the Secretary solicited public comment on the \nproposed regulations.\n\nAnalysis of Comments and Changes\n\n    In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, 17 persons \nsubmitted comments on the proposed regulations. The following is an \nanalysis of the comments and the changes in the regulations since \npublication of the NPRM. Substantive issues are discussed under the \nsection of the regulations to which they pertain. Technical and other \nminor changes made to the language published in the NPRM--and suggested \nchanges the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under \napplicable statutory authority--are not addressed.\n\nWho is Eligible for a Grant? (Section 647.2)\n\n    Comment: The Secretary received one comment regarding eligible \napplicants under this program. The commenter encouraged the Secretary \nto include ``disciplinary groups'' such as professional associations \nand public or private agencies or organizations or combinations of \nthese groups as eligible applicants under the McNair program. The \ncommenter indicated that these groups are included as eligible under \nsection 402A of the Higher Education Act of 1965 as amended (HEA) and \nthat the Department is being overly restrictive in this limitation.\n    Discussion: The Secretary believes Sec. 647.2 of these regulations \naccurately reflects section 402E of the HEA which authorizes the McNair \nprogram. While section 402A of the HEA denotes the full complement of \neligible applicants for all Federal TRIO Programs, institutions of \nhigher education and combinations of those institutions are generally \nthe only entities that can provide McNair program services. Further, \nsection 402E(d) of the HEA provides for specific award considerations \nfor institutions of higher education. However, applicants are \nencouraged to solicit and encourage the participation and coordination \nof professional associations, both private and public, to further \nenhance the quality of the services to be provided to the eligible \nparticipants.\n    Changes: None.\n\nWho Is Eligible To Participate in a McNair Grant? (Section 647.3)\n\n    Comments: Many commenters suggested that the Secretary change \nSec. 647.3 by deleting the eligibility requirement that students must \nhave completed their sophomore year of study to participate in the \nMcNair program. The commenters felt that this requirement was overly \nrestrictive and placed an additional eligibility requirement that went \nbeyond legislative intent. Further, the commenters felt that early \nintervention, even at the freshman level, may provide the program \nparticipants with necessary information and motivation necessary to \nmake future educational choices and decisions.\n    Discussion: The Secretary has determined that the requirement that \nstudents must have completed their sophomore year of study before they \nare eligible to participate in the McNair program is overly restrictive \nand has deleted the requirement. However, because of the small size of \nthe McNair program (less than 70 grants nationwide and under 2,000 \nparticipants currently), the Secretary encourages grantees to focus \nproject services on students in their junior and senior years of \nundergraduate study. Thus, the Secretary prefers to see the emphasis of \nthe McNair program placed on students who have completed the general \ncollege-wide requirements and are ready to select their major fields of \nstudy. Nevertheless, the Secretary will not absolutely preclude \nfreshmen and sophomores from participation in the McNair program. \nGrantees are advised that recipients of summer research internships \nmust have completed their sophomore year. It should be noted that a \ncompanion program, Student Support Services, emphasizes the provision \nof academic support services to freshmen and sophomore students, \nincluding mentoring and counseling, to encourage enrollment in \npostbaccalaureate programs of study.\n    Changes: The requirement that students must have completed their \nsophomore year of study to be eligible to participate in the McNair \nprogram has been deleted except with regard to summer research \ninternships.\n    Comments: Several commenters questioned whether the proposed \nregulations would allow students enrolled at the master's level of \nstudies to participate in the McNair program.\n    Discussion: The proposed regulations do not preclude the \nparticipation of students enrolled in master's level studies. However, \ngiven the types of activities and services normally provided by the \nMcNair program, the Secretary anticipates that students at the master's \nlevel of study probably have received effective preparation for \ndoctoral studies.\n    Changes: None.\n\nHow Long Is a Project Period? (Section 647.5)\n\n    Comment: The Secretary received one comment regarding whether the \nfour-to-five year grant award cycles would be made retroactive to \ninclude the grantees currently funded under the McNair program.\n    Discussion: Grant awards made in FY 1995 will be for either four or \nfive years, depending upon the peer review score received by applicants \nin the competition. The grant award cycle for currently funded grantees \nunder the McNair program will not be modified.\n    Changes: None.\n\nWhat Definitions Apply? (Section 647.7)\n\n    Comment: One commenter suggested that the definition for first-\ngeneration college student might be clarified by utilizing the language \nagreed upon in the Talent Search Program for the similar definition of \npotential first-generation college student (Sec. 643.7).\n    Discussion: The Secretary agrees with the commenter.\n    Changes: The definition of first-generation college student has \nbeen revised to reflect the definition of that term in the Talent \nSearch Program regulations.\n    Comments: None.\n    Discussion: The Secretary has reviewed the regulations since the \npublication of the NPRM and has determined that providing information \non what groups are underrepresented in graduate education is beneficial \nto all prospective applicants. However, there is no need to define both \nIndividuals from groups underrepresented in graduate education, and \nGroups underrepresented in graduate education.\n    Changes: The definition of ``Individuals from groups \nunderrepresented in graduate education'' has been deleted and replaced \nwith the definition of ``Groups underrepresented in graduate \neducation.''\n    Further, an additional definition has been added to this section \nfor ``target population.'' Applicants are asked to provide information \non their proposed ``target population'' under the ``Need'' criterion, \nwhich was revised in response to comments that the criterion not be \nrestricted to an applicant's student population.\n    Comments: Several commenters questioned the definition of summer \ninternship. Exception was taken to the phrase, ``* * * that normally \nwill occur between the junior and senior year * * *'' because it \nappears restrictive and one commenter suggested that the term \n``experienced practitioner'' be defined.\n    Discussion: The Secretary disagrees that the definition of this \nterm could be interpreted as requiring that a summer internship take \nplace only between a student's junior and senior years but decided to \ndelete the phrase nevertheless.\n    Changes: The definition of ``summer internship'' has been revised, \nand the Secretary has replaced the term ``experienced practitioners'' \nwith ``experienced faculty researchers.''\n\nHow Does the Secretary Decide which New Grants to Make? (Section \n647.20)\n\n    Comments: Two commenters observed that the eight point maximum \nprior experience score conflicts with the language included in the \nHigher Education Technical Amendments of 1993.\n    Discussion: The Secretary has raised the maximum prior experience \nscore to 15 points as required by a statutory change made by the Higher \nEducation Technical Amendments Act of 1993.\n    Changes: The maximum score for all the criteria in Sec. 647.22 is \nl5 points. Further, the Secretary has modified the maximum score for \neach criterion in that section to reflect the new total score.\n    Comments: One commenter objected to the provision that additional \npoints, equal to l0 percent of the applicant's score, be awarded to \napplications from Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Trust \nTerritory of the Pacific Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands. The \ncommenter objected because the commenter believes it gives those \napplicants an unfair advantage.\n    Discussion: The requirement that priority be given to proposals \nsubmitted by the territories was deleted from the Higher Education Act \nby the Higher Education Technical Amendments Act of 1993.\n    Changes: The provision has been deleted from Sec. 647.20(a) of the \nregulations.\n    Comments: Several commenters objected to Sec. 647.20(c) of the \nproposed regulations, which describes how the Secretary awards grants \nwhen two or more applications receive identical scores and all of these \napplications cannot be funded. The commenters suggested that the use of \na subjective selection factor such as geographical distribution was not \nimpartial and could possibly be construed as setting a new precedent \nfor other TRIO funding.\n    Discussion: The Secretary believes that a tie-breaker that takes \ninto account underserved geographic areas is appropriate. The Secretary \nfurther believes this provision reflects congressional concern \nregarding equitable distribution of services to geographic areas and \neligible populations that have been underserved by the program.\n    Changes: None.\n\nWhat Selection Criteria Does the Secretary Use? (Section 647.21)\n\n    Comments: Several commenters questioned why the ``Need'' criterion \nis based on the eligibility of students at the applicant institution \nwhen the program legislation does not restrict an applicant's service \narea to its own student population.\n    Discussion: The Secretary agrees that the ``Need'' criterion as \npublished could inadvertently restrict the applicant's service area.\n    Changes: Section 647.21(b) has been revised and reformatted to \nappear as Sec. 647.21(a).\n    Comments: One commenter suggested that Sec. 647.21(c)(2) would be \nstrengthened by adding an objectives section, which would require the \ninclusion of information on specific process and outcome objectives \nrelative to the purposes of the McNair program, their relevance in \naddressing the needs of the target group, and their clarity and \nattainability given the project budget and other resources.\n    Discussion: The Secretary has reviewed the proposed regulations and \ndetermined that the inclusion of process and outcome objectives would \nprovide relevant information about the quality of the proposed project. \nFurther, to avoid duplication or overlap of information requested, \nadditional changes within the selection criteria have been made to \ndelete the criterion, ``Meeting the purpose of the McNair program,'' to \ninclude a new criterion, ``Objectives,'' and to revise the criterion, \n``Plan of Operation.'' Also included is a redistribution of the points \nthat may be earned under each criterion.\n    Changes: Section 647.21 (b) and (c) has been modified to include a \nnew criterion, ``Objectives,'' a revision of the ``Plan of Operation'' \ncriterion, and a modification of the point distribution.\n    Comments: Several commenters suggested that Sec. 647.21(c)(2) \nappeared to be overly restrictive by requesting information on time \ncommitments for all employees of the project rather than just those \ndesignated as ``key'' personnel.\n    Discussion: As a result of the overall modification of the program \nselection criteria, the Secretary has concentrated all personnel \nconcerns in Sec. 647.21(d) of the revised selection criteria.\n    Changes: Section 647.21 has been modified.\n    Comments: One commenter suggested that the ``Plan of Operation'' \ncriterion failed to include language that mirrored section 402A(c)(6), \nwhich encourages coordination among TRIO programs and other programs \nfor disadvantaged students regardless of their funding source.\n    Discussion: The Secretary is aware of the legislative language to \ncoordinate programs for disadvantaged students and agrees that it \nshould be addressed in the regulations. Therefore, the selection \ncriteria, specifically Sec. 647.21(c)(8), have been modified to include \na request for pertinent information regarding any planned coordination \nactivities.\n    Changes: Section 647.21(c)(2) has been redesignated as \nSec. 647.21(c)(8) and modified to include language requesting details \nof planned coordination activities by the applicant.\n    Comments: Several commenters objected to the inclusion of fee \nwaivers or tuition waivers as requirements for funding consideration \nand point assignment included in Sec. 647.21(e)(3).\n    Discussion: The Secretary has reviewed the pertinent section under \nSec. 647.21(e)(3) and has determined that the phrase in question is \nappropriate. The waiving of fees is not required as a condition of \nfunding. Rather, the examples listed are but a few suggestions of the \nmany kinds of support that could be construed as positive in nature and \nan indicator of institutional commitment.\n    Changes: None.\n    Comments: Several commenters questioned the requirement contained \nin the proposed plan of operation (Sec. 647.21(c)(4)(i)), which states \nthat participants selected for the program be enrolled in programs of \nstudy in which a doctorate degree is the terminal degree. It was the \nconsensus of the commenters that this language infers that students in \nsome pre-professional programs (such as law or medical technology) \nmight be ineligible for program participation.\n    Discussion: The Secretary has reviewed the criterion and the \nlanguage in question has been deleted due to the overall modification \nof the plan of operation. However, it should be noted that the intent \nof section 402A describes the purpose of the McNair program as one that \nmotivates and prepares students for doctoral programs. Thus, this may \npreclude some fields of study that terminate at the master's level and \nsome preprofessional programs.\n    Changes: The plan of operation has been modified and the language \nin question has been deleted.\n    Comments: One commenter questioned the failure of the selection \ncriteria to include the award considerations contained in section \n402E(d)(3) of the HEA that called for consideration of students \nenrolled in projects authorized under this ``section.''\n    Discussion: The reference in section 402E(d)(3) to this ``section'' \nrefers to section 402E of the HEA, which is the section authorizing the \nMcNair Program. Therefore, since the only Federal TRIO Program that \nserves students already enrolled in institutions of higher education is \nthe Student Support Services program, the Secretary has interpreted \nthat section as applying to the Student Support Services program and \nhas revised Sec. 647.21(c)(3) accordingly.\n    Changes: Section 647.21(c)(3) has been revised and redesignated as \nSec. 647.21(c)(1).\n\nHow Does the Secretary Evaluate Prior Experience? (Section 647.22)\n\n    Comments: One commenter suggested that the consideration of \ninformation relevant to the previous five years of funding prior to the \nfiscal year under funding consideration provided an insufficient time \nframe to determine the relative success of projects in encouraging \nstudents to enter doctoral study. The commenter suggested that seven to \nten years was a more accurate indicator of success in this area.\n    Discussion: The Secretary agrees that seven to ten years may \nprovide a more comprehensive picture of the success of a project's \nendeavors to assure that students enter or complete a program of study \nleading to a doctoral degree. However, for the purposes of prior \nexperience, the most recent years' experience of the project is \nconsidered adequate, and thus the rationale for the five-year cap, \nsince that is the maximum grant award period allowed under current \nlegislation. To ensure the consistent application of this policy, \nSec. 647.22(a) has been revised to clearly state that the period to be \nconsidered is the performance period under an expiring McNair grant.\n    Changes: Section 647.22(a) has been modified.\n\nWhat are Allowable Costs? (Section 647.30)\n\n    Comments: Several commenters objected to the provision that \nrestricted the $2,400 stipend to the ``summer'' research internships. \nThey felt that this provision was overly restrictive and did not allow \nthe applicants flexibility in designing programs that most \nappropriately meet the unique needs of the students to be served.\n    Discussion: The Secretary has reconsidered the provision that ties \nthe payment of the $2,400 stipend to summer research internships. The \nSecretary will allow the payment of stipends for research internships \nthat take place other than in the summer.\n    Changes: Section 647.30(b) has been modified. Also, language has \nbeen added to Sec. 647.30(c) to clarify that tuition, room and board, \nand transportation costs are allowable only for summer internships \ninvolving research.\n\nWhat are Unallowable Costs? (Section 647.31)\n\n    Comments: Several commenters suggested that allowable costs should \ninclude student fees for test preparation workshops, colloquia or other \ncourses that directly increase the likelihood of a student entering a \ndoctoral program.\n    Discussion: The Secretary disagrees with the commenters because \nthis payment would constitute a form of direct student aid that is not \nallowed under this program except as provided for in Sec. 647.30. The \nprovision of the workshops, colloquia or courses under the project for \nall interested participants is, however, allowable.\n    Changes: None.\n\nWhat Other Requirements Must A Grantee Meet? (Section 647.32)\n\n    Comments: One commenter suggested that the phrase ``as a result of \nthe services'' be deleted from Sec. 647.32(b)(4) since the causal \nconnection between services and outcomes is often difficult to make.\n    Discussion: The Secretary agrees that the phrase in the proposed \nregulations may cause an undue hardship on grantees to demonstrate that \nsuch a relationship exists.\n    Changes: A change has been made in paragraph Sec. 647.32(b)(4) to \neliminate the phrase ``as a result of the services.''\n\nPaperwork Reduction Act of 1980\n\n    Sections 647.21, 647.22, and 647.32 contain information collection \nrequirements. As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the \nDepartment of Education will submit a copy of these sections to the \nOffice of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review. (44 U.S.C. \n3504(h))\n    Institutions of higher education and combinations of those \ninstitutions are eligible to apply for grants to carry out McNair \nProgram projects. The Department needs and uses the information to make \ngrants. Annual public reporting burden for this collection of \ninformation is estimated to average 20 hours per response for 68 \nrespondents, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching \nexisting data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and \ncompleting and reviewing the collection of information.\n    Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the \ninformation collection requirement should direct them to the Office of \nInformation and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Room 10235, New Executive \nOffice Building, Washington, D.C. 20503; Attention: Daniel J. Chenok.\n\nIntergovernmental Review\n\n    This program is subject to the requirements of Executive Order \n12372 and the regulations in 34 CFR Part 79. The objective of the \nExecutive order is to foster an intergovernmental partnership and a \nstrengthened federalism by relying on processes developed by State and \nlocal governments for coordination and review of proposed Federal \nfinancial assistance.\n    In accordance with the order, this document is intended to provide \nearly notification of the Department's specific plans and actions for \nthis program.\n\nAssessment of Educational Impact\n\n    In the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Secretary requested \ncomments on whether the proposed regulations would require transmission \nof information that is being gathered by or is available from any other \nagency or authority of the United States.\n    Based on the response to the proposed rules and on its own review, \nthe Department has determined that the regulations in this document do \nnot require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is \navailable from any other agency or authority of the United States.\n\nList of Subjects in 34 CFR Part 647\n\n    Colleges and universities, Disadvantaged students, Discretionary \ngrants, Educational programs, Graduate education, Reporting and \nrecordkeeping requirement.\n\n    Dated: August 17, 1994.\nDavid A.

The maximum score for each criterion is indicated in \nparentheses with the criterion.\n    (2)(i) For an application from an applicant who has carried out a \nMcNair project in the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year \nfor which the applicant is applying, the Secretary evaluates the \napplicant's prior experience on the basis of the criteria in \nSec. 647.22.\n    (ii) The maximum score for all the criteria in Sec. 647.22 is \nfifteen (15) points. The maximum score for each criterion is indicated \nin parentheses with the criterion.\n    (iii) If an applicant described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this \nsection applies for more than one new grant in the same fiscal year, \nthe Secretary applies the criteria in Sec. 647.22 to a project that \nseeks to continue support for an existing McNair project on that \ncampus.\n    (b) The Secretary makes new grants in rank order on the basis of \nthe total scores received by applications under paragraphs (a)(1) \nthrough (a)(3) of this section.\n    (c)(1) If the total scores of two or more applications are the same \nand there are insufficient funds for these applications after the \napproval of higher-ranked applications, the Secretary uses the \nremaining funds to achieve an equitable geographic distribution of all \nnew projects.\n    (2) In making an equitable geographic distribution of new projects, \nthe Secretary considers only the locations of new projects.\n    (d) The Secretary may decline to make a grant to an applicant that \ncarried out a Federal TRIO Program project that involved the fraudulent \nuse of funds.\n\n(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1070a-11 and 1070a-15)\n\n\nSec. 647.21  What selection criteria does the Secretary use?\n\n    The Secretary uses the following criteria to evaluate an \napplication for a new grant:\n    (a) Need (16 Points). The Secretary reviews each application to \ndetermine the extent to which the applicant can clearly and \ndefinitively demonstrate the need for a McNair project to serve the \ntarget population. In particular, the Secretary looks for information \nthat clearly defines the target population; describes the academic, \nfinancial and other problems that prevent potentially eligible project \nparticipants in the target population from completing baccalaureate \nprograms and continuing to postbaccalaureate programs; and demonstrates \nthat the project's target population is underrepresented in graduate \neducation, doctorate degrees conferred and careers where a doctorate is \na prerequisite.\n    (b) Objectives (9 points).

Policy.\n\n                    (a) It is the policy of the United States to assure \n                equality of opportunity, full participation, \n                independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for \n                persons with disabilities. The Federal Government as an \n                employer should serve as a model for the employment of \n                persons with disabilities and utilize the full \n                potential of these talented citizens.\n                    (b) The Civil Service Rules governing appointment \n                of persons with psychiatric disabilities were adopted \n                years ago when attitudes about mental illness were \n                different than they are today, which led to stricter \n                standards for hiring persons with psychiatric \n                disabilities than for persons with mental retardation \n                or severe physical disabilities. The Civil Service \n                Rules provide that persons with mental retardation, \n                severe physical disabilities, or psychiatric \n                disabilities may be hired under excepted appointing \n                authorities. While persons with mental retardation or \n                severe physical disabilities may be appointed for more \n                than 2 years and may convert to competitive status \n                after completion of 2 years of satisfactory service in \n                their excepted position, people with psychiatric \n                disabilities may not.\n                    (c) The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and \n                the President's Task Force on Employment of Adults with \n                Disabilities believe that the Federal Government could \n                better benefit from the contributions of persons with \n                psychiatric disabilities if they were given the same \n                opportunities available to people with mental \n                retardation or severe physical disabilities.\n\n                Sec. 2.

Consistent with the demands of efficiency \n                and cost effectiveness, the head of each executive \n                agency shall incorporate waste prevention and recycling \n                in the agency's daily operations and work to increase \n                and expand markets for recovered materials through \n                greater Federal Government preference and demand for \n                such products. It is the national policy to prefer \n                pollution prevention, whenever feasible. Pollution that \n                cannot be prevented should be recycled; pollution that \n                cannot be prevented or recycled should be treated in an \n                environmentally safe manner. Disposal should be \n                employed only as a last resort.\n\n                Sec. 102. Consistent with policies established by the \n                Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Policy \n                Letter 92-4, agencies shall comply with executive \n                branch policies for the acquisition and use of \n                environmentally preferable products and services and \n                implement cost-effective procurement preference \n                programs favoring the purchase of these products and \n                services.\n\n                Sec. 103. This order creates a Steering Committee, a \n                Federal Environmental Executive (FEE), and a Task \n                Force, and establishes Agency Environmental Executive \n                (AEE) positions within each agency, to be responsible \n                for ensuring the implementation of this order. The FEE, \n                AEEs, and members of the Steering Committee and Task \n                Force shall be full-time Federal Government employees.\n\n                PART 2--DEFINITIONS\n\n                For purposes of this order:\n\n                Sec. 201. ``Environmentally preferable'' means products \n                or services that have a lesser or reduced effect on \n                human health and the environment when compared with \n                competing products or services that serve the same \n                purpose.

In developing plans, \n                drawings, work statements, specifications, or other \n                product descriptions, agencies shall consider, as \n                appropriate, a broad range of factors including: \n                elimination of virgin material requirements; use of \n                biobased products; use of recovered materials; reuse of \n                product; life cycle cost; recyclability; use of \n                environmentally preferable products; waste prevention \n                (including toxicity reduction or elimination); and \n                ultimate disposal. These factors should be considered \n                in acquisition planning for all procurement and in the \n                evaluation and award of contracts, as appropriate. \n                Program and acquisition managers should take an active \n                role in these activities.\n\n                Sec. 402. Affirmative Procurement Programs. (a) The \n                head of each executive agency shall develop and \n                implement affirmative procurement programs in \n                accordance with section 6002 of RCRA (42 U.S.C. 6962) \n                and this order and consider use of the procurement \n                tools and methods described in 7 U.S.C. 5909. Agencies \n                shall ensure that responsibilities for preparation, \n                implementation, and monitoring of affirmative \n                procurement programs are shared between the program \n                personnel and acquisition and procurement personnel. \n                For the purposes of all purchases made pursuant to this \n                order, EPA, in consultation with such other executive \n                agencies as appropriate, shall endeavor to maximize \n                environmental benefits, consistent with price, \n                performance, and availability considerations, and \n                constraints imposed by law, and shall adjust \n                solicitation guidelines as necessary in order to \n                accomplish this goal.\n\n                    (b) Agencies shall establish affirmative \n                procurement programs for all EPA-designated guideline \n                items purchased by their agency. For newly designated \n                items, agencies shall revise their internal programs \n                within 1 year from the date the EPA designated the new \n                items.\n\n[[Page 49647]]\n\n                    (c) Exclusive of the biobased products described in \n                section 504, for the EPA-designated guideline items, \n                which are contained in 40 CFR part 247, and for all \n                future designated guideline items, agencies shall \n                ensure that their affirmative procurement programs \n                require 100 percent of their purchases of products to \n                meet or exceed the EPA guideline unless written \n                justification is provided that a product is not \n                available competitively within a reasonable time frame, \n                does not meet appropriate performance standards, or is \n                only available at an unreasonable price. Written \n                justification is not required for purchases below the \n                micropurchase threshold. For micropurchases, agencies \n                shall provide guidance regarding purchase of EPA-\n                designated guideline items. This guidance should \n                encourage consideration of aggregating purchases when \n                this method would promote economy and efficiency.\n                    (d) Within 90 days after the date of this order, \n                the head of each executive agency that has not \n                implemented an affirmative procurement program shall \n                ensure that the affirmative procurement program has \n                been established and is being implemented to the \n                maximum extent practicable.\n\n                Sec. 403. Federal Facility Compliance. (a) Within 6 \n                months of the date of this order, the Administrator of \n                the EPA shall, in consultation with the Federal \n                Environmental Executive, prepare guidance for use in \n                determining Federal facility compliance with section \n                6002 of RCRA and the related requirements of this \n                order.\n\n                    (b) EPA inspections of Federal facilities conducted \n                pursuant to RCRA and the Federal Facility Compliance \n                Act and EPA ``multi-media'' inspections carried out at \n                Federal facilities will include, where appropriate, \n                evaluation of facility compliance with section 6002 of \n                RCRA and any implementing guidance.\n                    (c) Where inspections of Federal facilities are \n                carried out by authorized States pursuant to RCRA and \n                the Federal Facility Compliance Act, the Administrator \n                of the EPA will encourage those States to include \n                evaluation of facility compliance with section 6002 of \n                RCRA in light of EPA guidance prepared pursuant to \n                subsection (a), where appropriate, similar to \n                inspections performed by the EPA. The EPA may provide \n                information and technical assistance to the States to \n                enable them to include such considerations in their \n                inspection.\n                    (d) The EPA shall report annually to the Federal \n                Environmental Executive on the results of inspections \n                performed by the EPA to determine Federal facility \n                compliance with section 6002 of RCRA not later than \n                February 1st for those inspections conducted during the \n                previous fiscal year.\n\n                PART 5--STANDARDS, SPECIFICATIONS, AND DESIGNATION OF \n                ITEMS\n\n                Sec. 501. Specifications, Product Descriptions, and \n                Standards. When developing, reviewing, or revising \n                Federal and military specifications, product \n                descriptions (including commercial item descriptions), \n                and standards, executive agencies shall consider \n                recovered materials and any environmentally preferable \n                purchasing criteria developed by the EPA, and ensure \n                the criteria are complied with in developing or \n                revising standards. Agencies shall report annually to \n                the FEE on their compliance with this section for \n                incorporation into the biennial report to the President \n                referred to in section 302(a)(2) of this order. (a) If \n                an inconsistency with section 6002 of RCRA or this \n                order is identified in a specification, standard, or \n                product description, the FEE shall request that the \n                Environmental Executive of the pertinent agency advise \n                the FEE as to why the specification cannot be revised \n                or submit a plan for revising it within 60 days.\n\n                    (b) If an agency is able to revise an inconsistent \n                specification but cannot do so within 60 days, it is \n                the responsibility of that AEE to monitor and implement \n                the plan for revising it.\n\n                Sec. 502. Designation of Items that Contain Recovered \n                Materials. In order to expedite the process of \n                designating items that are or can be made with \n                recovered materials, the EPA shall use the following \n                process for designating these items in accordance with \n                section 6002(e) of RCRA. (a) The EPA shall designate \n                items that are or can be made with recovered material, \n                by promul-\n\n[[Page 49648]]\n\n                gating amendments to the Comprehensive Procurement \n                Guideline (CPG). The CPG shall be updated every 2 years \n                or as appropriate after an opportunity for public \n                comment.\n\n                    (b) Concurrent with the issuance of the CPG, the \n                EPA shall publish for comment in the Federal Register \n                Recovered Materials Advisory Notices that present the \n                range of recovered materials content levels within \n                which the designated items are currently available. \n                These levels shall be updated periodically, after \n                opportunity for public comment, to reflect changes in \n                market conditions.\n                    (c) Once items containing recovered materials have \n                been designated by the EPA in the CPG, agencies shall \n                modify their affirmative procurement programs to \n                require that, to the maximum extent practicable, their \n                purchases of products meet or exceed the EPA guidelines \n                unless written justification is provided that a product \n                is not available competitively, not available within a \n                reasonable time frame, does not meet appropriate \n                performance standards, or is only available at an \n                unreasonable price.\n\n                Sec. 503. Guidance on Acquisition of Environmentally \n                Preferable Products and Services. (a) The EPA shall \n                develop guidance within 90 days from the date of this \n                order to address environmentally preferable purchasing. \n                The guidance may be based on the EPA's September 1995 \n                Proposed Guidance on the Acquisition of Environmentally \n                Preferable Products and Services and comments received \n                thereon. The guidance should be designed for \n                Government-wide use and targeted towards products and \n                services that have the most effect. The guidance may \n                also address the issues of use of the technical \n                expertise of nongovernmental entities and tools such as \n                life cycle assessment in decisions on environmentally \n                preferable purchasing. The EPA shall update this \n                guidance every 2 years, or as appropriate.\n\n                    (b) Agencies are encouraged to immediately test and \n                evaluate the principles and concepts contained in the \n                EPA's Guidance on the Acquisition of Environmentally \n                Preferable Products and Services through pilot projects \n                to provide practical information to the EPA for further \n                updating of the guidance. Specifically:\n                    (1) These pilot projects shall be focused around \n                those product and service categories, including \n                printing, that have wide use within the Federal \n                Government. Priorities regarding which product and \n                service categories to pilot shall be developed by the \n                individual agencies and the EPA, in consultation with \n                the OFPP, the FEE, and the appropriate agency \n                procurement executives. Any policy disagreements shall \n                be resolved by the Steering Committee.\n                    (2) Agencies are encouraged to use all of the \n                options available to them to determine the \n                environmentally preferable attributes of products and \n                services in their pilot and demonstration projects, \n                including the use of technical expertise of \n                nongovernmental entities such as labeling, \n                certification, or standards-developing organizations, \n                as well as using the expertise of the National \n                Institute of Standards and Technology.\n                    (3) Upon request and to the extent practicable, the \n                EPA shall assist executive agencies in designing, \n                implementing, and documenting the results of these \n                pilot and demonstration projects.\n                    (4) The EPA, in coordination with other executive \n                agencies, shall develop a database of information about \n                these projects, including, but not limited to, the \n                number and status of pilot projects, examples of \n                agencies' policy directives, revisions to \n                specifications, solicitation procedures, and grant/\n                contract policies that facilitate adoption of \n                environmentally preferable purchasing practices, to be \n                integrated on a commonly available electronic medium \n                (e.g., Internet Web site). These data are to be \n                reported to the FEE.\n                    (c) Executive agencies shall use the principles and \n                concepts in the EPA Guidance on Acquisition of \n                Environmentally Preferable Products and Services, in \n                addition to the lessons from the pilot and \n                demonstration projects, to the maximum extent \n                practicable, in identifying and purchasing environ-\n\n[[Page 49649]]\n\n                mentally preferable products and services and shall \n                modify their procurement programs as appropriate.\n\n                Sec. 504. Designation of Biobased Items by the USDA. \n                The USDA Biobased Products Coordination Council shall, \n                in consultation with the FEE, issue a Biobased Products \n                List. (a) The Biobased Products List shall be published \n                in the Federal Register by the USDA within 180 days \n                after the date of this order and shall be updated \n                biannually after publication to include additional \n                items.\n\n                    (b) Once the Biobased Products List has been \n                published, agencies are encouraged to modify their \n                affirmative procurement program to give consideration \n                to those products.\n\n                Sec. 505. Minimum Content Standard for Printing and \n                Writing Paper. Executive agency heads shall ensure that \n                their agencies meet or exceed the following minimum \n                materials content standards when purchasing or causing \n                the purchase of printing and writing paper: (a) For \n                high speed copier paper, offset paper, forms bond, \n                computer printout paper, carbonless paper, file \n                folders, white wove envelopes, writing and office \n                paper, book paper, cotton fiber paper, and cover stock, \n                the minimum content standard shall be no less than 30 \n                percent postconsumer materials beginning December 31, \n                1998. If paper containing 30 percent postconsumer \n                material is not reasonably available, does not meet \n                reasonable performance requirements, or is only \n                available at an unreasonable price, then the agency \n                shall purchase paper containing no less than 20 percent \n                postconsumer material. The Steering Committee, in \n                consultation with the AEEs, may revise these levels if \n                necessary.\n\n                    (b) As an alternative to meeting the standards in \n                sections 505(a), for all printing and writing papers, \n                the minimum content standard shall be no less than 50 \n                percent recovered materials that are a waste material \n                byproduct of a finished product other than a paper or \n                textile product that would otherwise be disposed of in \n                a landfill, as determined by the State in which the \n                facility is located.\n                    (c) Effective January 1, 1999, no executive branch \n                agency shall purchase, sell, or arrange for the \n                purchase of, printing and writing paper that fails to \n                meet the minimum requirements of this section.\n\n                Sec. 506. Revision of Brightness Specifications and \n                Standards. The GSA and other executive agencies are \n                directed to identify, evaluate, and revise or eliminate \n                any standards or specifications unrelated to \n                performance that present barriers to the purchase of \n                paper or paper products made by production processes \n                that minimize emissions of harmful byproducts. This \n                evaluation shall include a review of unnecessary \n                brightness and stock clause provisions, such as lignin \n                content and chemical pulp requirements. The GSA shall \n                complete the review and revision of such specifications \n                within 6 months after the date of this order, and shall \n                consult closely with the Joint Committee on Printing \n                during such process. The GSA shall also compile any \n                information or market studies that may be necessary to \n                accomplish the objectives of this provision.\n\n                Sec. 507. Procurement of Re-refined Lubricating Oil and \n                Retread Tires. (a) Agencies shall implement the EPA \n                procurement guidelines for re-refined lubricating oil \n                and retread tires. Fleet and commodity managers shall \n                take immediate steps, as appropriate, to procure these \n                items in accordance with section 6002 of RCRA. This \n                provision does not preclude the acquisition of biobased \n                (e.g., vegetable) oils.\n\n                    (b) The FEE shall work to educate executive \n                agencies about the new Department of Defense \n                Cooperative Tire Qualification Program, including the \n                Cooperative Approval Tire List and Cooperative Plant \n                Qualification Program, as they apply to retread tires.\n\n                PART 6--AGENCY GOALS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\n\n                Sec. 601. Agency Goals.

Establishment of the Air Traffic \n                Organization. (a) The Secretary of Transportation \n                (Secretary) shall, consistent with his legal \n                authorities, move to establish within the Federal \n                Aviation Administration (FAA) a performance-based \n                organization to be known as the ``Air Traffic \n                Organization'' (ATO).\n\n                    (b) The ATO shall be composed of those elements of \n                the FAA's Air Traffic Services and Research and \n                Acquisition organizations that have direct connection \n                and give support to the provision of day-to-day \n                operational air traffic services, as determined by the \n                Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration \n                (Administrator). The Administrator may delegate \n                responsibility for any operational activity of the air \n                traffic control system to the head of the ATO. The \n                Administrator's responsibility for general safety, \n                security, and policymaking functions for the National \n                Airspace System is unaffected by this order.\n                    (c) The Chief Operating Officer (COO) of the Air \n                Traffic Control System, established by the Wendell H. \n                Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st \n                Century (Air-21) (Public Law 106-181), shall head the \n                ATO and shall report directly to the Administrator and \n                be subject to the authority of the Administrator. The \n                COO, in consultation with the Air Traffic Control \n                Subcommittee of the Aviation Management Advisory \n                Committee, shall enter into an annual performance \n                agreement with the Administrator that sets forth \n                measurable organization and individual goals in key \n                operational areas and describes specific targets and \n                how such goals will be achieved. The COO may receive an \n                annual bonus not to exceed 30 percent of the annual \n                rate of basic pay, based upon the Administrator's \n                evaluation of the COO's performance in relation to the \n                targets and goals described above.\n                    (d) The COO shall develop a 5-year strategic plan \n                for the air traffic control system, including a clear \n                statement of the mission and objectives for the \n                system's safety, efficiency, and productivity. This \n                strategic plan must ensure that ATO actions are \n                consistent with long-term FAA strategies for the \n                aviation system as a whole.\n                    (e) The COO shall also enter into a framework \n                agreement with the Administrator that will establish \n                the relationship of the ATO with the other \n                organizations of the FAA.\n\n                Sec. 2. Purpose. The FAA's primary mission is to ensure \n                the safety, security, and efficiency of the National \n                Airspace System. The purpose of this order is to \n                enhance that mission and further improve the delivery \n                of air traffic services to the American public by \n                reorganizing the FAA's air traffic services and related \n                offices into a performance-based, results-oriented, \n                organization. The ATO will be better able to make use \n                of the unique procurement and personnel authorities \n                that the FAA currently has and to better use the \n                additional management reforms enacted by the Congress \n                this year under Air-21. Specifically, the ATO shall:\n\n[[Page 77494]]\n\n                    (a) optimize use of existing management \n                flexibilities and authorities to improve the efficiency \n                of air traffic services and increase the capacity of \n                the system;\n                    (b) develop methods to accelerate air traffic \n                control modernization and to improve aviation safety \n                related to air traffic control;\n                    (c) develop agreements with the Administrator of \n                the FAA and users of the products, services, and \n                capabilities it will provide;\n                    (d) operate in accordance with safety performance \n                standards developed by the FAA and rapidly respond to \n                FAA safety and security oversight findings;\n                    (e) consult with its customers, the traveling \n                public, including direct users such as airlines, cargo \n                carriers, manufacturers, airports, general aviation, \n                and commercial space transportation providers, and \n                focus on producing results that satisfy the FAA's \n                external customer needs;\n                    (f) consult with appropriate Federal, State, and \n                local public agencies, including the Department of \n                Defense and the National Aeronautics and Space \n                Administration, to determine the best practices for \n                meeting the diverse needs throughout the National \n                Airspace System;\n                    (g) establish strong incentives to managers for \n                achieving results; and\n                    (h) formulate and recommend to the Administrator \n                any management, fiscal, or legislative changes \n                necessary for the organization to achieve its \n                performance goals.\n\n                Sec. 3. Aviation Management Advisory Committee. The Air \n                Traffic Control Subcommittee of the Aviation Management \n                Advisory Committee shall provide, consistent with its \n                responsibilities under Air-21, general oversight to ATO \n                regarding the administration, management, conduct, \n                direction, and supervision of the air traffic control \n                system.\n\n                Sec. 4. Evaluation and Report. Not later than 5 years \n                after the date of this order, the Aviation Management \n                Advisory Committee shall provide to the Secretary and \n                the Administrator a report on the operation and \n                effectiveness of the ATO, together with any \n                recommendations for management, fiscal, or legislative \n                changes to enable the organization to achieve its \n                goals.\n\n                Sec. 5. Definitions. The term ``air traffic control \n                system'' has the same meaning as the term defined by \n                section 40102(a)(42) of title 49, United States Code.\n\n                Sec. 6.

R.C.M. 502(c) is amended to read as follows:\n\n                  L``(c) Qualifications of military judge. A military \n                    judge shall be a commissioned officer of the armed \n                    forces who is a member of the bar of a Federal \n                    court or a member of the bar of the highest court \n                    of a State and who is certified to be qualified for \n                    duty as a military judge by the Judge Advocate \n                    General of the armed force of which such military \n                    judge is a member. In addition, the military judge \n                    of a general court-martial shall be designated for \n                    such duties by the Judge Advocate General or the \n                    Judge Advocate General's designee, certified to be \n                    qualified for duty as a military judge of a general \n                    court-martial, and assigned and directly \n                    responsible to the Judge Advocate General or the \n                    Judge Advocate General's designee. The Secretary \n                    concerned may prescribe additional qualifications \n                    for military judges in special courts-martial.

A one-way closed circuit television \n                    system may be used if deemed necessary by the \n                    military judge. The accused will also be provided \n                    private, contemporaneous communication with his \n                    counsel. The procedures described herein shall be \n                    employed unless the accused has made a knowing and \n                    affirmative waiver of these procedures.\n\n                  L  (3) Effect on accused's rights generally. An \n                    election by the accused to be absent pursuant to \n                    subsection (c)(1) shall not otherwise affect the \n                    accused's right to be present at the remainder of \n                    the trial in accordance with this rule.''\n\n\n[[Page 55116]]\n\n\n\n                    c.

The privilege may \n                    be claimed by the patient or the guardian or \n                    conservator of the patient. A person who may claim \n                    the privilege may authorize trial counsel or \n                    defense counsel to claim the privilege on his or \n                    her behalf.

The term \n                    ``exploitation'' means child pornography or child \n                    prostitution. The term ``negligent treatment'' \n                    means the failure to provide, for reasons other \n                    than poverty, adequate food, clothing, shelter, or \n                    medical care so as to endanger seriously the \n                    physical health of the child. The term ``domestic \n                    violence'' means an offense that has as an element \n                    the use, attempted use, or threatened use of \n                    physical force against a person and is committed by \n                    a current or former spouse, parent, or guardian of \n                    the victim; by a person with whom the victim shares \n                    a child in common; by a person who is cohabiting \n                    with or has cohabited with the victim as a spouse, \n                    parent, or guardian; or by a person similarly \n                    situated to a spouse, parent, or guardian of the \n                    victim.\n\n                  L  (3) Remote live testimony will be used only where \n                    the military judge makes a finding on the record \n                    that a child is unable to testify in open court in \n                    the presence of the accused, for any of the \n                    following reasons:\n\n                  L  (A) The child is unable to testify because of \n                    fear;\n\n                  L  (B) There is substantial likelihood, established \n                    by expert testimony, that the child would suffer \n                    emotional trauma from testifying;\n\n                  L  (C) The child suffers from a mental or other \n                    infirmity; or\n\n\n[[Page 55119]]\n\n\n                  L  (D) Conduct by an accused or defense counsel \n                    causes the child to be unable to continue \n                    testifying.\n\n                  L  (4) Remote live testimony of a child shall not be \n                    utilized where the accused elects to absent himself \n                    from the courtroom in accordance with R.C.M. \n                    804(c).''\n\n                Sec. 3. Part IV of the Manual for Courts-Martial, \n                United States, is amended as follows:\n\n                    a. Insert the following new paragraph after \n                paragraph 100:\n\n                  L100a. Article 134--(Reckless endangerment)\n\n                  La. Text. See paragraph 60.\n\n                  Lb. Elements.\n\n                  L  (1) That the accused did engage in conduct;\n\n                  L  (2) That the conduct was wrongful and reckless or \n                    wanton;\n\n                  L  (3) That the conduct was likely to produce death \n                    or grievous bodily harm to another person; and\n\n                  L  (4) That under the circumstances, the conduct of \n                    the accused was to the prejudice of good order and \n                    discipline in the armed forces or was of a nature \n                    to bring discredit upon the armed forces.\n\n                  Lc. Explanation.\n\n                  L  (1) In general. This offense is intended to \n                    prohibit and therefore deter reckless or wanton \n                    conduct that wrongfully creates a substantial risk \n                    of death or serious injury to others.\n\n                  L  (2) Wrongfulness. Conduct is wrongful when it is \n                    without legal justification or excuse.\n\n                  L  (3) Recklessness. ``Reckless'' conduct is conduct \n                    that exhibits a culpable disregard of foreseeable \n                    consequences to others from the act or omission \n                    involved. The accused need not intentionally cause \n                    a resulting harm or know that his conduct is \n                    substantially certain to cause that result. The \n                    ultimate question is whether, under all the \n                    circumstances, the accused's conduct was of that \n                    heedless nature that made it actually or imminently \n                    dangerous to the rights or safety of others.\n\n                  L  (4) Wantonness. ``Wanton'' includes ``reckless,'' \n                    but may connote willfulness, or a disregard of \n                    probable consequences, and thus describe a more \n                    aggravated offense.\n\n                  L  (5) Likely to produce. When the natural or \n                    probable consequence of particular conduct would be \n                    death or grievous bodily harm, it may be inferred \n                    that the conduct is ``likely'' to produce that \n                    result. See paragraph 54c(4)(a)(ii).\n\n                  L  (6) Grievous bodily harm. ``Grievous bodily harm'' \n                    means serious bodily injury. It does not include \n                    minor injuries, such as a black eye or a bloody \n                    nose, but does include fractured or dislocated \n                    bones, deep cuts, torn members of the body, serious \n                    damage to internal organs, and other serious bodily \n                    injuries.\n\n                  L  (7) Death or injury not required. It is not \n                    necessary that death or grievous bodily harm be \n                    actually inflicted to prove reckless endangerment.\n\n                  Ld. Lesser included offenses. None.\n\n                  Le. Maximum punishment. Bad-conduct discharge, \n                    forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and \n                    confinement for 1 year.\n\n                  Lf. Sample specification. In that \n                    ______________________ (personal jurisdiction \n                    data), did, (at/on board--location) (subject-matter \n                    jurisdiction data, if required), on or about \n                    ________________________ 19____, wrongfully and \n                    recklessly engage in conduct, to wit:\n\n                  L(he/she)(describe conduct) and that the accused's \n                    conduct was likely to cause death or serious bodily \n                    harm to __________________.''\n\n                Sec. 4.

The maximum punishment for an offense committed \n                prior to 1 November 1999, shall not exceed the \n                applicable maximum in effect at the time of the \n                commission of such offense.\n                    g.

The active duty requirement does not appear in \n                Article 26, UCMJ which prescribes the qualifications \n                for military judges.

The analysis accompanying R.C.M. \n                804 is amended by redesignating the current subsection \n                (c) as subsection (d) and by inserting after subsection \n                (b) the following new subsection (c):\n                    L  ``(c) Voluntary absence for limited purpose of \n                child testimony.\n                    L  1999 Amendment: The amendment provides for two-\n                way closed circuit television to transmit a child's \n                testimony from the courtroom to the accused's location. \n                The use of two-way closed circuit television, to some \n                degree, may defeat the purpose of these alternative \n                procedures, which is to avoid trauma to children.

The analysis to R.C.M. \n                1001(b)(4) is amended by inserting the following \n                paragraph before the analysis of R.C.M. 1001(b)(5):\n                    L  ``1999 Amendment: R.C.M. 1001(b)(4) was amended \n                by elevating to the Rule language that heretofore \n                appeared in the Discussion to the Rule. The Rule was \n                further amended to recognize that evidence that the \n                offense was a ``hate crime'' may also be presented to \n                the sentencing authority. The additional ``hate crime'' \n                language was derived in part from section 3A1.1 of the \n                Federal Sentencing Guidelines, in which hate crime \n                motivation results in an upward adjustment in the level \n                of the offense for which the defendant is sentenced. \n                Courts-martial sentences are not awarded upon the basis \n                of guidelines, such as the Federal Sentencing \n                Guidelines, but rather upon broad considerations of the \n                needs of the service and the accused and on the premise \n                that each sentence is individually tailored to the \n                offender and offense. The upward adjustment used in the \n                Federal Sentencing Guidelines does not directly \n                translate to the court-martial presentencing procedure. \n                Therefore, in order to adapt this concept to the court-\n                martial process, this amendment was made to recognize \n                that ``hate crime'' motivation is admissible in the \n                court-martial presentencing procedure. This amendment \n                also differs from the Federal Sentencing Guideline in \n                that the amendment does not specify the burden of proof \n                required regarding evidence of ``hate crime'' \n                motivation. No burden of proof is customarily specified \n                regarding aggravating evidence admitted in the \n                presentencing procedure, with the notable exception of \n                aggravating factors under R.C.M. 1004 in capital \n                cases.''\n                    e. R.C.M. 1003(b). The analysis accompanying R.C.M. \n                1003 is amended by adding the following as the last \n                paragraph of the analysis:\n                    L  ``1999 Amendment: Loss of numbers, lineal \n                position, or seniority has been deleted. Although loss \n                of numbers had the effect of lowering precedence for \n                some purposes, e.g., quarters priority, board and court \n                seniority, and actual date of promotion, loss of \n                numbers did not affect the officer's original position \n                for purposes of consideration for retention or \n                promotion. Accordingly, this punishment was deleted \n                because of its negligible consequences and the \n                misconception that it was a meaningful punishment.''\n                    f. R.C.M. 1004. The analysis to R.C.M. 1004(c)(7) \n                is amended by adding the following as the last \n                paragraph of the analysis:\n                    L  ``1999 Amendment: R.C.M. 1004(c)(7)(K) was added \n                to afford greater protection to victims who are \n                especially vulnerable due to their age.''\n\n[[Page 55122]]\n\n                2.

Evid. \n                501 is amended--\n                      (1) by striking:\n                    L``The privilege expressed in Rule 302 and its \n                conforming Manual change in Para. 121, is not a doctor-\n                patient privilege and is not affected by Rule 501(d).''\n                      (2) by adding at the end:\n                    L  ``1999 Amendment: The privileges expressed in \n                Rule 513 and Rule 302 and the conforming Manual change \n                in R.C.M. 706, are not physician-patient privileges and \n                are not affected by Rule 501(d).''\n                    b. Mil. R. Evid. 513. Insert the following analysis \n                after the analysis of Mil. R. Evid. 512:\n                    L  ``1999 Amendment: Military Rule of Evidence 513 \n                establishes a psychotherapist-patient privilege for \n                investigations or proceedings authorized under the \n                Uniform Code of Military Justice. Rule 513 clarifies \n                military law in light of the Supreme Court decision in \n                Jaffee v. Redmond, 518 U.S. 1, 116 S. Ct. 1923, 135 \n                L.Ed.2d 337 (1996). Jaffee interpreted Federal Rule of \n                Evidence 501 to create a federal psychotherapist-\n                patient privilege in civil proceedings and refers \n                federal courts to state laws to determine the extent of \n                privileges. In deciding to adopt this privilege for \n                courts-martial, the committee balanced the policy of \n                following federal law and rules, when practicable and \n                not inconsistent with the UCMJ or MCM, with the needs \n                of commanders for knowledge of certain types of \n                information affecting the military. The exceptions to \n                the rule have been developed to address the specialized \n                society of the military and separate concerns that must \n                be met to ensure military readiness and national \n                security. See Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733, 743 (1974); \n                U.S. ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U.S. 11, 17 (1955); \n                Dept. of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 530 (1988). \n                There is no intent to apply Rule 513 in any proceeding \n                other than those authorized under the UCMJ. Rule 513 \n                was based in part on proposed Fed. R. Evid. (not \n                adopted) 504 and state rules of evidence.\n                    L  Rule 513 is not a physician-patient privilege. \n                It is a separate rule based on the social benefit of \n                confidential counseling recognized by Jaffee, and \n                similar to the clergy-penitent privilege. In keeping \n                with American military law since its inception, there \n                is still no physician-patient privilege for members of \n                the Armed Forces. See the analyses for Rule 302 and \n                Rule 501.\n                    L(a) General rule of privilege. The words ``under \n                the UCMJ'' in this rule mean Rule 513 applies only to \n                UCMJ proceedings, and do not limit the availability of \n                such information internally to the services, for \n                appropriate purposes.\n                    L(d) Exceptions. These exceptions are intended to \n                emphasize that military commanders are to have access \n                to all information that is necessary for the safety and \n                security of military personnel, operations, \n                installations, and equipment. Therefore, \n                psychotherapists are to provide such information \n                despite a claim of privilege.''\n                    c. Mil. R. Evid. 611. The analysis accompanying \n                Rule 611 is amended by adding at the end of the \n                analysis the following:\n                    L  ``1999 Amendment: Rule 611(d) is new. This \n                amendment to Rule 611 gives substantive guidance to \n                military judges regarding the use of alternative \n                examination methods for child victims and witnesses in \n                light of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Maryland \n                v. Craig, 497 U.S. 836 (1990) and the change in Federal \n                law in 18 U.S.C. section 3509. Although Maryland v. \n                Craig dealt with child witnesses who were themselves \n                the victims of abuse, it should be noted that 18 U.S.C. \n                section 3509, as construed by Federal courts, has been \n                applied to allow non-victim child\n\n[[Page 55123]]\n\n                witnesses to testify remotely. See, e.g., United States \n                v. Moses, 137 F.3d 894 (6th Cir. 1998) (applying \n                section 3509 to a non-victim child witness, but \n                reversing a child sexual assault conviction on other \n                grounds) and United States v. Quintero, 21 F.3d 885 \n                (9th Cir. 1994) (affirming conviction based on remote \n                testimony of non-victim child witness, but remanding \n                for re-sentencing). This amendment recognizes that \n                child witnesses may be particularly traumatized, even \n                if they are not themselves the direct victims, in cases \n                involving the abuse of other children or domestic \n                violence. This amendment also gives the accused an \n                election to absent himself from the courtroom to \n                prevent remote testimony. Such a provision gives the \n                accused a greater role in determining how this issue \n                will be resolved.''\n\n                3. Changes to Appendix 23, the Analysis accompanying \n                the Punitive Articles (Part IV, MCM).\n\n                    The following paragraph is inserted after the \n                analysis of paragraph 100:\n                    L``100a.

App.), and in order to stimulate \n                the creation and early adoption of technologies needed \n                to make biobased products and bioenergy cost-\n                competitive in large national and international \n                markets, it is hereby ordered as follows:\n\n                Section 1. Policy. Current biobased product and \n                bioenergy technology has the potential to make \n                renewable farm and forestry resources major sources of \n                affordable electricity, fuel, chemicals, \n                pharmaceuticals, and other materials. Technical \n                advances in these areas can create an expanding array \n                of exciting new business and employment opportunities \n                for farmers, foresters, ranchers, and other businesses \n                in rural America. These technologies can create new \n                markets for farm and forest waste products, new \n                economic opportunities for underused land, and new \n                value-added business opportunities. They also have the \n                potential to reduce our Nation's dependence on foreign \n                oil, improve air quality, water quality, and flood \n                control, decrease erosion, and help minimize net \n                production of greenhouse gases. It is the policy of \n                this Administration, therefore, to develop a \n                comprehensive national strategy, including research, \n                development, and private sector incentives, to \n                stimulate the creation and early adoption of \n                technologies needed to make biobased products and \n                bioenergy cost-competitive in large national and \n                international markets.\n\n                Sec. 2. Establishment of the Interagency Council on \n                Biobased Products and Bioenergy. (a) There is \n                established the Interagency Council on Biobased \n                Products and Bioenergy (the ``Council''). The Council \n                shall be composed of the Secretaries of Agriculture, \n                Commerce, Energy, and the Interior, the Administrator \n                of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Director of \n                the Office of Management and Budget, the Assistant to \n                the President for Science and Technology, the Director \n                of the National Science Foundation, the Federal \n                Environmental Executive, and the heads of other \n                relevant agencies as may be determined by the Co-Chairs \n                of the Council. Members may serve on the Council \n                through designees. Designees shall be senior officials \n                who report directly to the agency head (Assistant \n                Secretary or equivalent).\n\n                    (b) The Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary \n                of Energy shall serve as Co-Chairs of the Council.\n                    (c) The Council shall prepare annually a strategic \n                plan for the President outlining overall national goals \n                in the development and use of biobased products and \n                bioenergy in an environmentally sound manner and how \n                these goals can best be achieved through Federal \n                programs and integrated planning. The goals shall \n                include promoting national economic growth with \n                specific attention to rural economic interests, energy \n                security, and environmental sustainability and \n                protection. These strategic plans shall be compatible \n                with the national goal of producing safe and affordable \n                supplies of food, feed, and fiber in a way that is \n                sustainable and protects the environment, and shall \n                include measurable objectives. Specifically, these \n                strategic plans shall cover the following areas:\n                    L(1) biobased products, including commercial and \n                industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals, products with \n                large carbon sequestering capacity, and other \n                materials; and\n\n[[Page 44640]]\n\n                    L(2) biomass used in the production of energy \n                (electricity; liquid, solid, and gaseous fuels; and \n                heat).\n                    (d) To ensure that the United States takes full \n                advantage of the potential economic and environmental \n                benefits of bioenergy, these strategic plans shall be \n                based on analyses of: (1) the economic impacts of \n                expanded biomass production and use; and (2) the \n                impacts on national environmental objectives, including \n                reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
