_Feel free to look around, but this code depended on the now-defunct Orchestrate database-as-a-service._

# Executive Order Data

This repository includes four files that include every Executive Order issued by the last three U.S. Presidents through 2014. The data is in [Orchestrate Export Format](https://orchestrate.io/docs/data-export) and meant to be used in tandem with the [Executive Order Search](https://github.com/adamd/exor) sample application.
